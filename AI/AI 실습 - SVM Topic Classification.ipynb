I\\'ll typein the handout he gave out at\\nthe meeting. Here goes : \\n\\n\\t\\t\\tThe Microlight Solar Sail\\n\\t\\t\\t-------------------------\\n\\n1. Introduction\\nThe solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of\\nsunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a\\nvehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.\\n\\nHowever it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most\\npeople realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per\\nsquare kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized\\nfabric which would be necessary to transport a \\'conventional\\' type\\nspacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte\\nidea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.\\n\\n2.Design\\nRecent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a\\ntiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely\\nbe electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control\\nmethods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a\\npanel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.\\n\\nThe key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at\\nEdinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data\\ngathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and\\ncommunication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface\\nof the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of\\nthe mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.\\n\\n3.Missions\\nThe craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example:\\na) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor\\ngroups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit\\nrate.\\nb) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved\\nareas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to\\nreflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive\\nsunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that\\nvolatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these\\nlocations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar\\nbase, BTW]\\nc) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet\\nnucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft\\ncauses it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged\\ntube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an\\nideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat\\nis reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300\\ndeg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating\\ncontainer.\\n\\nContact: Colin Jack                              Tel. 0865-200447\\nOxford Mathematical Designs, 131 High Street, Oxford OX1 4DH, England\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nThis guy would love to hear from anyone interested in this project or\\nseeking details or anything, and would be most happy to send you more\\ninformation.\\n\\n\\tAndy\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\n                                  ----------------------------------- \\nAndy Jonathan J.

But thanks\\nto major design refinements implemented in recent months, JPL\\'s\\nSpace Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) -- a major project\\nconsidered to be in trouble a couple of years ago -- is \"alive\\nand well,\" according to Project Scientist Michael Werner.\\n     A lighter spacecraft, revised orbit and shorter mission have\\nadded up to a less expensive project with \"tremendous scientific\\npower\" and a bright future, said Werner.\\n     Designed as a follow-up to the highly successful Infrared\\nAstronomical Satellite (IRAS) and Cosmic Background Explorer\\n(COBE) missions, SIRTF -- a cryogenically cooled observatory for\\ninfrared astronomy from space -- is scheduled for launch in 2000\\nor 2001 if plans proceed as scheduled.\\n     IRAS\\' pioneering work in space-based infrared astronomy 10\\nyears ago allowed astronomers to view the Milky Way as never\\nbefore and revealed, among other things, 60,000 galaxies and 25\\ncomets. It provided a sky survey 1,000 times more sensitive than\\nany previously available from ground-based observations. COBE has\\nmeasured the infrared and microwave background radiation on large\\nangular scales, and revealed new facts about the early universe.\\n     But to illuminate SIRTF\\'s potential, Jim Evans, JPL\\'s\\nmanager of Astrophysics and Fundamental Physics Pre-Projects,\\nrecently said that the project is \"1,000 to 1 million times more\\ncapable than IRAS,\" based on technological advances in infrared\\ndetector arrays.\\n     However, despite the enormous strides in infrared\\nexploration SIRTF promised, and the fact that it was cited as the\\nhighest priority new initiative for all of astronomy in the 1990s\\n(by the National Academy of Sciences), it took a \"diet or die\"\\ndirective from NASA Headquarters last year to keep the project\\ngoing, according to Werner.\\n     The project is now known as Atlas SIRTF, based on the key\\nfactor in its new design: The satellite will orbit the sun\\ninstead of the Earth, permitting the use of an Atlas rocket\\nlaunch instead of the formerly proposed and heavier Titan. \"The\\nmain advantage of the solar orbit is that you can use all of your\\nlaunch capability for boosting the payload -- you don\\'t have to\\ncarry up a second rocket to circularize the orbit,\" Werner said.\\nThe other advantage to a solar orbit, he said, is that \"it\\'s in a\\nbetter thermal environment, away from the heat of the Earth.\"\\n     Additional major changes in SIRTF\\'s redesign include\\nshortening the mission from five to three years and building a\\nspacecraft that is less than half as heavy as in the original\\nplan -- Atlas SIRTF will weigh 2,470 kilograms (5,400 pounds)\\ncompared to Titan SIRTF\\'s 5,500 kilograms (12,100 pounds).\\n     All of that adds up to \"a less stressful launch\\nenvironment,\" Werner said, and a cost savings of more than $200\\nmillion for the launch, in addition to increased savings in the\\ndesign of the smaller, less massive spacecraft.\\n     Werner said SIRTF\\'s redesign came as a result of Congress\\'\\ntelling NASA \"you\\'re trying to do too many things. If you want us\\nto support SIRTF, which is a good project, develop a plan to see\\nhow it fits into (NASA\\'s) overall strategy.\"\\n     Shortly thereafter, SIRTF was named as NASA\\'s highest\\npriority \"flagship\" scientific mission by the interdisciplinary\\nSpace Sciences Advisory Committee, in addition to the blessing\\nfrom the National Academy of Sciences.\\n     While the spacecraft and its instruments required descoping\\nto keep the project alive, SIRTF\\'s major scientific contribution\\nalways promised to come about from its advanced infrared detector\\narrays, which will allow images to be developed \"tens of\\nthousands of times faster\" than before, according to Evans.\\n     \"Up until a couple of years ago,\" Werner said, \"all infrared\\nastronomy was done with single detectors -- or very small arrays\\nof individually assembled detectors. Since then, the Department\\nof Defense has developed a program to produce arrays of tens or\\nhundreds of thousands of detectors, rather than just a few, and\\nthose are very well suited for use on SIRTF.\"\\n     Werner noted that in addition to dealing with budget\\npressures, Congress is currently watching NASA projects with an\\neye out for any \"technological spinoff.\"\\n     \"On that question, I think we have some things to say,\" he\\nsaid, \"because the detectors we\\'re using are straight off various\\nmilitary developments. Also, SIRTF will be built by the U.S.\\naerospace industry, and it\\'s a real technological and engineering\\nchallenge in addition to being a tremendous scientific project.\\n     \"SIRTF will be used by the entire astronomical community,\"\\nWerner added, but the revised three-year mission \"puts a premium\\non observing time. We have to educate the user community and\\ndevelop a program that involves early surveys and quick\\nturnaround of the data.\"\\n     Werner said the downsizing of the project required a\\nreduction in scope and complexity of SIRTF\\'s three instruments --\\nthe infrared spectrograph, infrared array camera and multiband\\nimaging photometer. However, these reductions will only result in\\nlosses of efficiency rather than capability, he said.\\n     The project hopes to start a \"Phase B\" activity in 1995,\\nwhich will provide a detailed concept for development and design.\\nBuilding the hardware would begin about two years later.\\n     Projected cost estimates, Evans said, are $850 million-$950\\nmillion.\\n     \"I am very optimistic about SIRTF,\" he said. \"It will\\nprovide a tremendous return for the investment.\"\\n     Werner added that an additional benefit from the project\\nwill be the \"enrichment of our intellectual and cultural\\nenvironment. People on the street are very interested in\\nastronomy ... black holes, the possibility of life on other\\nplanets, the origin of the universe ... and those are the kind of\\nquestions SIRTF will help answer.\"\\n                              ###\\n     ___    _____     ___\\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\\\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\\n    | | | |  __ \\\\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\\n\\n',\n",

Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, and\\ncommercial space.  This is how it went...\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO,\\nI called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty\\nMurray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard\\nthe gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour.\\nLater in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.\\n\\nWe got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide,\\nwho scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not\\nbozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to \\nmake sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.\\n\\nWell, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking\\nto him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.\\nWe covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.  \\nMost of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another\\nwoman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that\\nwe brought up.\\n\\nBut, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate\\naligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.\\nSo, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to\\nLEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming \\nfeasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.\\nWe hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism\\npaper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the\\natmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog\\nover L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is \\nmore pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to \\nunderstanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education \\nwhereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that\\nthey havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other\\nfields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday \\nwould provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.\\n\\nWe hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business\\nangle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal\\ncommunicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided\\nin those sectors.\\n\\nJobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..\\nWe mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.\\n\\nWe left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order\\nto make this even easier to do.

For\\nproviding me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.\\nSpace Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket\\nTechnology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to\\nlower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --\\nand I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for\\nour generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.\\n\\n     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a\\ntorch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new\\nthing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things\\nfrom past masters.\\n\\n     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called\\nexperts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no\\nsense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of\\nthe Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,\\n\"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space.\" \\nWell Dr. Rachtin -- you\\'ve made us mad!  What are these\\nprinciples that SSRT defies?\\n\\n     Well I\\'ll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need\\na giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the\\n\"fact\" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it\\nviolates the truism that you cant do anything significant for\\nless than many billions of dollars.\\n\\n     It took some of the last generation\\'s experts to teach us\\nsome new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun\\'s first rocket was not a\\nSaturn V.  General Schriever\\'s ICBM\\'s didn\\'t take ten years to\\ndemonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn\\'t cost $1 billion.\\n\\n     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950\\'s to remind\\nus of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a\\nsenior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,\\ncheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a\\nsingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960\\'s. \\nBecause he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a\\nlittle, Test a little.\\n\\n     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We\\ndidn\\'t solicit a bunch of requirements -- they\\'d just change\\nevery few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The\\nALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better\\nknown as \"Shape Shifter\" than \"Space Lifter.\"  We didn\\'t spend a\\nlot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When\\'s the\\nlast time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn\\'t\\ntake a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in\\n18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of\\none very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the\\nthreat that he\\'d get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if\\nit ran over cost or schedule.\\n\\n     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn\\'t keep in mind its\\nonly a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps\\nthat can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But\\neach step should follow the same principles -- a small management\\nteam -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest\\nbudget.\\n\\n     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:\\n(See charts)\\n\\n     I\\'m embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last\\ngeneration -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950\\'s\\nand 1960\\'s.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that\\ncan\\'t see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we\\ncould do is soft-land on Earth!\\n\\n     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a\\nlittle, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable\\nand routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among\\nyou -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal\\nprotection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land\\nhorizontally, etc, etc.\\n\\n     I say to you -- we\\'ll see you at White Sands in June.  You\\nbring your view-graphs, and I\\'ll bring my rocketship.  If we do\\nwhat we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.  [ not\\nincluded in the speech:  If we fail -- you still have your\\nprogram offices, staff summary sheets, requirement analyses, and\\ndecade long programs.]\\n\\n     I bet on my generation and Max Hunter\\'s idea -- Any Takers?\\n',\n",

The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE\\n    archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest. The portion of his manifest formerly\\n    included in this FAQ has been removed; please refer to his posting or\\n    the archived copy. For the most up to date information on upcoming\\n    missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.\\n\\n    Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news\\n    frequently.\\n\\n\\n    WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?\\n\\n    The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks\\n    (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).\\n\\n    The \"Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,\" ASC G&C 2102,\\n    says:\\n\\n\\t\"During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is\\n\\tcommanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower\\n\\tclearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)\\n\\torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a\\n\\tnegative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other\\n\\tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort\\n\\tmaneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of\\n\\tthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining\\n\\tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target\\n\\tin second stage.\"\\n\\n    This really is a good answer, but it\\'s couched in NASA jargon. I\\'ll try\\n    to interpret.\\n\\n    1)\\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.\\n\\n    2)\\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack\\n\\tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the\\n\\t\"relative wind\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line\\n\\tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly\\n\\tnegative angle (\"a negative q-alpha\").\\tThis causes a little bit of\\n\\t\"downward\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z\\n\\tdirection) and this force \"alleviates structural loading.\"\\n\\tWe have to be careful about those wings -- they\\'re about the\\n\\tmost \"delicate\" part of the vehicle.\\n\\n    3)\\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more\\n\\tmass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or\\n\\tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be\\n\\tthe case if we didn\\'t roll (\"performance gain\").\\n\\n    4)\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated\\n\\tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort\\n\\tmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\"decreased abort maneuver\\n\\tcomplexity\").\\n\\n    5)\\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio\\n\\tantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio\\n\\tantennae on the Orbiter (\"improved S-band look angles\").\\n\\n    6)\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a\\n\\thelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.\\n\\n    7)\\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is\\n\\tmore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east\\n\\t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity\\n\\tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:\\n\\tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.\\n\\tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its\\n\\tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.\\n\\n    This all begs the question, \"Why isn\\'t the launch pad oriented to give\\n    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to\\n    achieve that attitude?\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers\\n    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one\\n    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main\\n    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime\\n    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is\\n    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \"top\"\\n    [Orbiter side] and the \"bottom\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The\\n    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented\\n    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V\\'s.  (A side note: the\\n    Saturn V\\'s also had a roll program.  Don\\'t ask me why -- I\\'m a Shuttle\\n    guy.)\\n\\n    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\\tHe added that the \"roll\\n    maneuver\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.\\n    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\\n    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping\\n    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw\\n    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total\\n    maneuver is really expressed as a \"quaternion,\" a grad-level-math\\n    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element\\n    array.\\n\\n\\n    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT\\n\\n    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite\\n    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72\\n    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed\\n    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from\\n    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.\\n    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite\\n    for these viewers.\\n\\n    If you can\\'t get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.\\n    It\\'s worth asking if yours doesn\\'t.\\n\\n    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is\\n    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press\\n    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle\\n    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying\\n    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions\\n    are not being covered.\\n\\n\\n    AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS\\n\\n    The following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:\\n\\n\\tW6FXN  - Los Angeles\\n\\tK6MF   - Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California\\n\\tWA3NAN - Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Greenbelt, Maryland.\\n\\tW5RRR  - Johnson Space Center (JSC), Houston, Texas\\n\\tW6VIO  - Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California.\\n\\tW1AW Voice Bulletins\\n\\n\\tStation    VHF\\t   10m\\t   15m\\t   20m\\t  40m\\t 80m\\n\\t------\\t ------  ------  ------  ------  -----\\t-----\\n\\tW6FXN\\t 145.46\\n\\tK6MF\\t 145.585\\t\\t\\t 7.165\\t3.840\\n\\tWA3NAN\\t 147.45  28.650  21.395  14.295  7.185\\t3.860\\n\\tW5RRR\\t 146.64  28.400  21.350  14.280  7.227\\t3.850\\n\\tW6VIO\\t 224.04\\t\\t 21.340  14.270\\n\\tW6VIO\\t 224.04\\t\\t 21.280  14.282  7.165\\t3.840\\n\\tW1AW\\t\\t 28.590  21.390  14.290  7.290\\t3.990\\n\\n    W5RRR transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the\\n    other frequencies supplying Keplerian Elements and mission information.\\n\\n    W1AW also transmits on 147.555, 18.160.

How serious is this project?  Is this just in the \"wild\\n>idea\" stage or does it have real funding?\\n  \\n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\\n  \\nSPACE ADVERTISING\\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\\'s logos on the\\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\\n   This has not been considered \"paid advertising\" but rather\\n\"public relations\", since the restrictions have been such that only\\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\\na 10\\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\\nis \"advertising\" as much as it is \"public relations\", in my\\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\\'s which looked at\\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\\nbay.  These ventures would be different than \"public relations\", in\\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\\nwould scan past it.)\\n  \\nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\\'s upcoming movie \"The Last\\nAction Hero\".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\\nmain fuselage of the mission\\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it \"would not use\\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\\nreceiving compensation.\"   This is being disputed, since the launch\\nis a \"commercial launch\" and NASA is receiving none of the\\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\\ncoming from NASA.)\\n  \\nORBITAL \"BILLBOARDS\"\\n   Orbital \"billboards\" have been the staple of science fiction for\\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\\nHeinlein described another in \"The Man Who Sold the Moon\".  Several\\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the \"Eiffel\\nII\" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\\'s Bi-centennial.\\n                                                (cont)\\n\\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\\n',\n",

I walked by, and they were showing real-time video capture\\nusing a (Radious or SuperMac?) card to digitize and make right on the spot\\nquicktime movies.  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one\\n(1.5).\\n\\n   They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something.  It played back quite\\nnicely and in real time.  The guy then expanded the window (resized) to 25x by\\n3xx (320 in y I think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it\\nwasn't 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Then he\\nincreased it just a bit more, and it dropped to 10<->12 fps. \\n\\n   Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra (don't know\\nwhat model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime\\ncould play back at the same speed even on an LCII.\\n\\n   Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having\\na little bit of trouble.  And this wasn't even from the hardisk!  This was\\nfrom memory!\\n\\n   Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime, or some\\nhardware assisted Centris, or another software product running the \\nanimation (like supposedly MacroMind's Accelerator?)?\\n\\n   Don't misunderstand me, I just want to clarify this.\\n\\n   But for the sake of the posting about a computer doing it or not, I can\\nclaim 320x200 (a tad more with overscan) being done in 256,000+ colors in \\nmy computer (not from the hardisk) at 30fps with Scala MM210.\\n\\n   But I agree, if we consider MPEG stuff, I think a multimedia consumer\\nlow-priced box has a lot of market...

PEXlib is a slightly\\n\"lower\" level API which was designed to efficiently support the PEX\\nextension to X.\\n\\nSome advantages of using PEXlib...\\n- Integrates with Xlib,Xt,Motif,etc. better than PHIGS\\n- Provides immediate mode capabilities\\n- Is free of \"policy\"\\n- PEX supports PHIGS, but is currently being extended to support\\n  features not found in PHIGS (like texture mapping, anti-aliasing).\\n  PEXlib will give you access to all of these features.\\n\\nSome advantages of using PHIGS...\\n- Support for multiple devices, not just X based ones\\n- Support for archiving, metafiles, hardcopy output\\n- PHIGS has predefined input devices to make input easier\\n- PHIGS can handle exposure events and resizing for you\\n- PHIGS can help you with colormap selection/creation.\\n\\nIf you\\'re working strictly in X and don\\'t care about things like\\narchiving, I would go with PEXlib.

The effect of the first Sputniks \\nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \\ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \\nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \\nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \\nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \\nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \\n\\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \\nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \\ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \\nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \\nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \\ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \\nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \\n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \\none weekend, \"getting away from it all\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \\nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \\nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \\nmiles to the east.  (Their \\'security light\\' didn\\'t help matters \\nmuch either.)  But I\\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \\nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \\n\\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\\'t \\nfouled in some way.  (I mean they\\'ve been TRYING this forever - \\nlike, concerning Tesla\\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don\\'t watch \\ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \\ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \\nIf ya\\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \\nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \\n\\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \\nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \\n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \\nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I\\'ll be trying to see it \\nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \\nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \\nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that \\nas it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, \\neven if it can\\'t ever be perfectly achieved. \\n\\nRegards, \\nWm. Hathaway \\nBaltimore MD \\n',\n",

Just give me the cheapest\\nheaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If I\\ndon\\'t have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I\\'ll use it.\\n\\nBut back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about a\\nlow cost (it\\'s all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General\\nDynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper\\nstage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two\\nunmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. \\nTotal cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9\\nbillion for the US share.\\n\\nI didn\\'t find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I\\'d bet that\\nits  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric\\ntonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew\\nhabitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for\\nthe additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be\\nable to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious,\\nthat\\'s a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors\\neats up a bit of LOX.  And I\\'m not certain if a home brewed (or\\ncollege-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let\\'s round\\nthis up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton\\npayloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, two\\nLEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for a\\nyear.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way of\\ndelivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone\\nhave a more precise guess about how much a year\\'s supply of consumables and\\nequipment would weigh?\\n\\nAnd I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discarded\\nto burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled? \\nHenry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10\\nengines.  Aren\\'t they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1? \\nI\\'ve forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the\\nDC-1.\\n\\nAll in all, I\\'m not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the\\nmoon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the first\\nnon-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned\\nmoon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from\\nlunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Find\\nsome way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goal\\nmight result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared\\nto win.

Everyone,\\n\\nBecause no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guess\\nmy question was not so clear. Now I\\'d like to describe it in detail:\\n\\nThe offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which\\nrolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse\\nand its offset is same everywhere.\\n\\nThis problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used.\\nThe tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the\\npositions of the ball\\'s center. Is the offset of an ellipse still\\nan ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial\\nStandard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was\\nimplemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold\\ninternationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!!\\nHow many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most\\nimportantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?\\n\\nI was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year\\nto specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this\\nproblem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear)\\nis not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire\\nor half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from\\na quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not\\nanalytical. I am now wondering if I didn\\'t touch the base and make things\\ncomplicated. Please give me a hint.\\n\\nI know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not.\\nHowever, so many people involved in the problem \"sphere from 4 poits\".\\nWhy not an ellipse?

I would prefer a method that would do this in as little\\n>  time as possible.  I need this for use in a forward raytracing\\n>  program.\\n\\nI think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and\\npolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of\\npoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.\\n\\nFirst, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\\nJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\\nexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\\ncompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\\nor possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\\n\\nNow, the phrasing of this question says \"if a line intersects a polygon\", so\\nthis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\\nto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.\\n\\nIn recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a\\nnew language called PostScript.  (See \"PostScript Language\", by Adobe Systems\\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\\n\\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\\ndraws the line L and the polygon P, and then \"outputs\" the answer.  By\\n\"output\", we mean the program executes a command called \"showpage\", which\\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus\\nthe original problem.\\n\\nThere are two small problems with this approach. \\n\\n\\t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\\n\\treduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn\\'s Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\\n\\n\\t(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the\\n\\tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in\\n\\tother words, will it halt?\\n\\n\\tNow, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\\n\\tTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is\\n\\tundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn\\n\\tout to be undecidable.\\n\\n\\nI won\\'t even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite\\nprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.\\n\\nA couple of references might be:\\n\\n1.

By the well known\\nDobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc.\\n37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to\\nHamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an\\nacronym) is probably only NP-complete.

I\\'ve \\ntranscribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means\\ninfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is \\ngranted to copy this without restriction.\\n\\nMichael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an\\ninformal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois.\\nACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and\\nInternational Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the\\ncompany is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that\\nhis daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.\\n\\nThe concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga\\nto visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king,\\nwho happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which \\nthe king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million,\\nHis Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought\\nthere probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous\\nsatellite slots.  While this isn\\'t entirely off the wall, it was very unusual,\\nseeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of\\nslots.\\n\\nThe whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl\\nHilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions\\nsupporting Tonga\\'s case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from \\n70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside).\\nAccording to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the\\nworld because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and \\nthe Pacific Rim. \\n\\nRIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax\\nhaven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to\\nfill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have\\ncost approximately $2 billion.  It\\'s not easy to raise that kind of money.\\nEventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began \\nnegotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in \\nMoscow in such harsh terms that I don\\'t think I\\'ll visit there for a long time.\\nBesides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way\\nthat people operate.  For example \"everybody can sell you everything.\"  \\nEveryone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the\\nonly ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.\\n\\nEventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost\\nof $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg\\nsays that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who \\nwent to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was\\nout of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He\\nagain described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually,\\nhe worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the \\nRussian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions\\nbefore signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to \\nallow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.\\n\\nThe next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied \\nMechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in \\nSiberia (can\\'t figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built\\nabout 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that\\nsiberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest\\npeople who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this\\npoint there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on\\nboth siberians and midwesterners :-)\\n\\nSternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is \\napparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that\\nwould sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them \\nspecifications, they\\'ll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites\\nthat RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This\\ncompares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1\\nmillion compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their \\nsatellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They \\nhave the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give\\nyou their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are\\ngetting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place\\nnow.\\n\\nTidbits:\\n\\n*  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big\\nbusiness because big business is just like what they have over there, except\\nthat \"we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.\"\\n\\n*  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch\\nwithin 9 months.\\n\\n*  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement\\nfund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia,\\nand a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is\\nsort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.\\n\\n*  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried\\npartly because we aren\\'t used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying\\nmonolith.  Italy gets a new government \"every two weeks\" but we don\\'t worry \\nbecause we\\'re used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what\\nreally goes on in Russia we won\\'t worry about their stability as much.\\n\\n*  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering\\nmoney.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting\\n25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the \"equivalent\" value in \\nrubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian\\nbank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that\\nthe only the contractors get swindled by the government.\\n\\n*  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western \\nsatellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type\\nof satellites, which was rather reassuring.\\n\\n*  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive\\ntechnology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have\\na lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare\\nwell with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much \\nshorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the \\ndifference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition,\\nshorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer\\ntechnology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date\\nhardware.\\n\\n-- \\nJosh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\\n\\t\\t    \"Find a way or make one.\"\\n\\t             -attributed to Hannibal\\n',\n",

But they have been systematically \\n          IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years! \\n\\n               The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he \\n          calls the \"Reciprocal System\", is built on two fundamental \\n          postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of \\n          space and time: \\n    \\n               (1) \"The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE \\n          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE \\n          UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.\" \\n    \\n               (2) \"The physical universe conforms to the relations of \\n          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are \\n          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.\" \\n    \\n               From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE \\n          Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of \\n          translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-\\n          rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward \\n          SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light \\n          (which Larson called \"UNIT VELOCITY\" and \"THE NATURAL \\n          DATUM\"). \\n      \\n               At each step in the development, Larson was able to \\n          MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the \\n          REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles \\n          [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star \\n          clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white \\n          dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET \\n          DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY \\n          BURSTS). \\n          \\n               And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom, \\n          Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-\\n          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility \\n          and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of \\n          matter. \\n\\n               All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy \\n          complex mathematics, in his books. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          BOOKS of Dewey B.

Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the \\n          organization that was started to promote Larson\\'s Theory.  \\n          They have other related publications, including the quarterly \\n          journal \"RECIPROCITY\". \\n\\n          \\n\\n          Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s Background\\n    \\n               Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer \\n          (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he \\n          died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in \\n          Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He \\n          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE \\n          chemical properties based only on the elements used. \\n    \\n               Larson\\'s lack of a fancy \"PH.D.\" degree might be one \\n          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is \\n          NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider \\n          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same \\n          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX \\n          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, \\n          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC \\n          ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. \\n     \\n               Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally \\n          test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  \\n          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER \\n          researchers\\' experimental and observational data.  And in \\n          many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. \\n    \\n               A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX \\n          physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking \\n          for a \"unified field theory\" that works, but have been \\n          IGNORING one for over 30 years now! \\n    \\n               \"Modern physics\" does NOT explain the physical universe \\n          so well.  Some parts of some of Larson\\'s books are FULL of \\n          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who \\n          agree.  And remember that \"epicycles\", \"crystal spheres\", \\n          \"geocentricity\", \"flat earth theory\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED \\n          to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. \\n    \\n    \\n               Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, \\n          was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson\\'s Theory, and was (or \\n          still is) President of Larson\\'s organization, \"THE \\n          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\", and Editor of \\n          their quarterly Journal \"RECIPROCITY\".  He moved to \\n          Minneapolis after retiring. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          \"Super Collider\" BOONDOGGLE!\\n          \\n               I am AGAINST contruction of the \"Superconducting Super \\n          Collider\", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS \\n          WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \"scientific\" \\n          value. \\n    \\n               Most physicists don\\'t realize it, but, according to the \\n          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist \\n          Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY \\n          particles (\"mesons\", \"hyperons\", ALLEGED \"quarks\", etc.) \\n          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, \\n          Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are \\n          CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly \\n          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible \\n          with their environment. \\n    \\n               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a \\n          few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not \\n          seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE \\n          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW! \\n    \\n               Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 \\n          BILLION cost?!!  Don\\'t we have much more important uses for \\n          this WASTED money?! \\n    \\n     \\n               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed \\n          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some \\n          kind of \"fire ants\" eating the insulation off underground \\n          cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water \\n          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of \\n          the \"Supercollider\"?! \\n    \\n          \\n               Naming the \"Super Collider\" after Ronald Reagon, as \\n          proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be \\n          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST. \\n      \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Anti-Matter\\n          \\n               In Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of \\n          opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more \\n          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the \\n          photons of which they are made, in relation to the \\n          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, \\n          which Larson calls \"Unit Velocity\" and the \"Natural Datum\". \\n     \\n               In Larson\\'s Theory, a positron is actually a particle of \\n          MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, \\n          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their \\n          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each \\n          other. \\n      \\n               In Larson\\'s Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical \\n          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension \\n          of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our \\n          MATERIAL half. \\n       \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Relativity\\n          \\n               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury \\n          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the \\n          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this \\n          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational \\n          perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, \\n          etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to \\n          help \"prove\" Einstein\\'s \"General Theory of Relativity\". \\n    \\n               But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results \\n          CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \"General Relativity\" can, by \\n          INSTEAD using \"SPECIAL Relativity\".  In one or more of his \\n          books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH \\n          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. \\n    \\n               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \"General Relativity\" as another \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \"Special \\n          Relativity\", including the parts about \"mass increases\" near \\n          the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on \\n          doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than \\n          1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, \\n          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). \\n     \\n               In Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead \\n          of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured \\n          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one \\n          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low \\n          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are \\n          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and \\n          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. \\n          [Larson often used the term \"COORDINATE TIME\" when writing \\n          about this.] \\n    \\n     \\n               In regard to \"mass increases\", it has been PROVEN in \\n          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near \\n          the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is \\n          ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists \\n          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson\\'s Theory, \\n          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is \\n          actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS \\n          BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.  \\n          The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward \\n          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of \\n          the so-called \"Big Bang\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL \\n          FANTASY). \\n    \\n                                    \\n          \\n          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\n\\n               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \"THE UNIVERSE \\n          OF MOTION\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific \\n          Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 \\n          pages, indexed, hardcover. \\n    \\n               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL \\n          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that \\n          author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. \\n    \\n               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical \\n          mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and \\n          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of \\n          the \"3-degree\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-\\n          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white \\n          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. \\n    \\n               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL \\n          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with \\n          OPEN MINDS! \\n    \\n               The following is an example of his Theory\\'s success: \\n          In his first book in 1959, \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL \\n          UNIVERSE\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING \\n          GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding \\n          them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson\\'s \\n          comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he \\n          had an immediate related explanation for them also. \\n    \\n\\n \\n          GAMMA-RAY BURSTS\\n\\n               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching \\n          their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were \\n          originally thought to originate from \"neutron stars\" in the \\n          disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in \\n          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions \\n          uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT \\n          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of \\n          directional coincidence). \\n    \\n               Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by \\n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of \\n          his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", published in 1984, the \\n          gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the \\n          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls \\n          the \"Cosmic Sector\".  Because of the relationship between the \\n          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and \\n          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can \\n          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at \\n          random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do \\n          not correspond with known objects, and come from all \\n          directions uniformly.) \\n    \\n               I wonder how close to us in space a source location \\n          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most \\n          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to \\n          stop it! \\n    \\n               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which \\n          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were \\n          actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! \\n    \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation\\n          \\n               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the \\n          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox \\n          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory \\n          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. \\n    \\n               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY \\n          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of \\n          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey \\n          B. Larson. \\n    \\n               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is \\n          detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" \\n          and in some of his other books. \\n    \\n               First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate \\n          energy by \"fusion\".  A small fraction comes from slow \\n          gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE \\n          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each \\n          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the \\n          element is, the lower is this limit.  A star\\'s internal \\n          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and \\n          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually \\n          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and \\n          lighter elements. \\n    \\n               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the \\n          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I \\n          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron \\n          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms \\n          and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some \\n          of his books [better than I can]. \\n    \\n               When the star explodes, the lighter material on the \\n          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less \\n          than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center \\n          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to \\n          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The \\n          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and \\n          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN \\n          SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. \\n    \\n               Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall \\n          back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown \\n          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The \\n          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a \\n          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward \\n          the \"MAIN SEQUENCE\" from opposite directions on the H-R \\n          Diagram. \\n    \\n               The chances of the two masses falling back into the \\n          exact same location in space, making a single lone star \\n          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY \\n          system, orbiting each other. \\n     \\n               According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE \\n          DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the \\n          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown \\n          outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \"degenerate matter\", \"neutron \\n          stars\", \"black holes\", etc.. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation\\n\\n               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the \\n          exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single \\n          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \"mini\" white dwarf \\n          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably \\n          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected \\n          by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS! \\n      \\n               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all \\n          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive \\n          his own version of Bode\\'s Law. \\n          \\n\\n\\n          \"Black Hole\" FANTASY!\\n\\n               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently \\n          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \"black \\n          holes\" merging together into a SINGLE \"black hole\", and \\n          concluded that the new \"black hole\" would have MORE MASS than \\n          the sum of the two original \"black holes\". \\n    \\n               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED \\n          FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \"black \\n          holes\", etc.! \\n    \\n               After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s books about \\n          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe, especially his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", it is \\n          clear to me that \"black holes\" are NOTHING more than \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is \\n          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \"black \\n          hole\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want \\n          to \"prove\" their theory. \\n    \\n    \\n               By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is \\n          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and \\n          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking\\'s severe physical \\n          problem somehow makes him \"wiser\".  It does NOT! \\n    \\n               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist \\n          Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread \\n          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson\\'s \\n          Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of \\n          Unified Science). \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION\\n\\n               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection \\n          with UFO\\'s and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to \\n          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. \\n    \\n               I found a possible clue about why they might work on \\n          pages 112-113 of the book \"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\", by \\n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of \\n          Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe.  I quote one paragraph: \\n    \\n               \"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development \\n          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally \\n          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  \\n          The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It \\n          was brought out in Volume I [Larson\\'s book \"NOTHING BUT \\n          MOTION\"] that there are physical processes in operation which \\n          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, \\n          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in \\n          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities \\n          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are \\n          limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of \\n          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the \\n          universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged \\n          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension \\n          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, \\n          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open \\n          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently \\n          in the same location with respect to the natural reference \\n          system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the \\n          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, \\n          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by \\n          the progression of the natural reference system.  All \\n          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons \\n          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  \\n          Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, \\n          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The \\n          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth \\n          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\" \\n          \\n               Note that in Larson\\'s Theory, UNcharged electrons are \\n          also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a \\n          particular frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) spinning \\n          around one axis at a particular rate (below the \"unit\" rate).  \\n          (\"Unit velocity\" is the speed of light, and there are \\n          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, \\n          according to Larson\\'s Theory.)  [I might have the \"above\" and \\n          \"below\" labels mixed up.] \\n    \\n               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-\\n          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of \\n          light! \\n    \\n               If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION \\n          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these \\n          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a \\n          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to \\n          achieve propulsion. (In Larson\\'s Theory, an electrical charge \\n          is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular \\n          frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) superimposed on the \\n          rotation of the particle.) \\n      \\n               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to \\n          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is \\n          generated in clouds. \\n\\n\\n\\n          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics\\n\\n               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B.

JPEG is designed for compressing either\\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\\ndrawings.\\n\\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\\nrespectively.\\n\\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\\'t\\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\\nthe fact that small color details aren\\'t perceived as well as small details\\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\\ninvisible to the eye.\\n\\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\\nfiles if you don\\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\\naren\\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\\n\\n\\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\\n\\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\\n\\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\\n\\nIf your viewing software doesn\\'t support JPEG directly, you\\'ll have to\\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\\nextra time to decompress the file.  I\\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\\n\\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\\n\\n\\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\\n\\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\\'t have 24-bit display\\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\\n\\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\\nby GIF.  JPEG can\\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\\n\\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\\nparticularly objectionable with text that\\'s only a few pixels high.\\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\\'t JPEG it.\\n\\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\\n\\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\\n\\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\\na GIF, you\\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you\\'ll have to make for yourself.\\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\\nconvert well.\\n\\n\\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\\n\\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B.\\n\\nFile\\t   Size in bytes\\t\\tComments\\n\\nship.ppm\\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\\n\\t\\t\\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\\nship.ppm.Z\\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\\n\\t\\t\\t compress doesn\\'t accomplish a lot, you\\'ll note.\\n\\t\\t\\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\\nship.gif\\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\\n\\t\\t\\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\\n\\t\\t\\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\\n\\nship.jpg95\\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\\n\\t\\t\\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\\nship.jpg75\\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\\n\\t\\t\\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\\nship.jpg50\\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\\n\\t\\t\\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\\n\\t\\t\\t for, you could tell it\\'s been JPEGed without seeing\\n\\t\\t\\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\\n\\t\\t\\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\\nship.jpg25\\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\\n\\t\\t\\t JPEG\\'s characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\\n\\t\\t\\t Still, I\\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\\n\\t\\t\\t of poorer image quality than this.\\nship.jpg5o\\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\\n\\t\\t\\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\\n\\t\\t\\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\\n\\t\\t\\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\\n\\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that\\'s a factor of four or five smaller\\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\\nratio for real-world scenes.\\n\\n\\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\\n\\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\\nit\\'s not a percentage of anything.\\n\\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\\n\\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\\n\\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\\n\\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\\n\\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\\nquality scale.  Some programs don\\'t even provide a numeric scale, just\\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\\n\\n\\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\\n\\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\\nIf you don\\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\\n(If you don\\'t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it\\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\\nthe news.answers archive.\\n\\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\\n\\n\\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\\n\\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\\nkind of system.  If you don\\'t see what you want for your machine, check out\\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\\n\\nX Windows:\\n\\nJohn Bradley\\'s free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG,\\nGIF, and other image formats.  It\\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu\\nor ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called \\'xv-???.tar.Z\\' (where ??? is the\\nversion number, currently 2.21); it is located in the \\'contrib\\' directory on\\nexport or the \\'pub/xv\\' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits\\ninternally, which means it\\'s not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit\\ndisplay (you\\'ll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn\\'t use XV to\\nconvert full-color images to JPEG, because they\\'ll get color-quantized first.\\nBut XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.\\nCAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check\\nthe \"save at normal size\" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will\\nbe blurry.\\n\\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\\'s free ImageMagick package,\\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\\nbasic free JPEG software.\\n\\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\\nfile contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\\n\\n\\nMS-DOS:\\n\\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\\n\\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel\\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\\nThe current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic\\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\\nnot flashy, but it\\'s functional.\\n\\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\\'s Hiview.  The\\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there\\'s no denying that it\\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\\n\\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\\nVESA driver, so don\\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\\nthat the driver is missing.)\\n\\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\\nthe net for a while, but I don\\'t know any stable archive location for it.\\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\\n\\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\\'s JPEG implementation isn\\'t very good:\\nit\\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\\'d have been nice to see a\\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\\n\\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\\'t get *any*\\nof them to work, you\\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs\\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\\nhave hi-color hardware, don\\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\\nthing with hi-color displays.)\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group\\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\\n\\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\\nparticular, you can\\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\\'s proprietary\\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\\n\\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\\'s key archive site for PC-related programs\\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows:\\n\\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\\ndue to Windows\\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\\n\\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\\nBut it\\'s so fast you\\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\\n\\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\\'t create new JPEG\\nfiles, and it doesn\\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\\'s\\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\\n\\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\\n286-compatible version; if you register, you\\'ll get the 386-only version,\\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\\n\\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\\n\\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\\nmode, not in a window.\\n\\nOS/2:\\n\\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip\\n    Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip\\n    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows\\n    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip\\n    PMView 0.84: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing\\n    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed\\n    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.\\n\\nMacintosh:\\n\\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of\\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\\'re running System 6, you must also install\\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\\n\\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\\n\\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\\'s\\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\\nlike this behavior, some don\\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\\'s user interface is very\\nwell thought out.\\n\\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\\'s faster with QuickTime.)\\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\\n\\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\\n\\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\\n\\nApple\\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\\'s tool, and it\\'s\\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\\nit, as it\\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\\n\\nStorm Technology\\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\\'t\\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\\ndownloaded image file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\\n\\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\\ndon\\'t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\\n\\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\\nJPEG file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\\n\\nAmiga:\\n\\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\\n\\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It\\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\\n\\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\\n\\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\\n\\nIf you\\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\\n\\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\\nit\\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\\n\\nAtari ST:\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\\n\\nI have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris,\\nbut surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.\\n\\nAcorn Archimedes:\\n\\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\\n\\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\\n\\nThere\\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\\nCambridge, UK.

To display a full-color image, the\\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We\\'re stuck with\\nthe standard usage though.)\\n\\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\\n\\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\\nThis happens because JPEG\\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little\\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\\n\\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it\\'s nearly meaningless to talk about\\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\\n(a) hasn\\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\\nnumber of colors just isn\\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\\npalette, and the format doesn\\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.)\\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\\'t have to.\\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\\'re stuck with the sender\\'s\\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\\nFurthermore, if the sender didn\\'t use a high-quality color quantization\\nalgorithm, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\\nfor all users whose machines don\\'t match the sender\\'s display hardware.\\nJPEG\\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\\'s display\\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you\\'re stuck forevermore with what was\\nsent.\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\\'s\\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\\n\\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\\nin a machine-independent fashion.\\n\\n\\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\\n\\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\\ncoding.  This article\\'s long enough already, so I\\'m not going to say more\\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\\n\\n\\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\\n\\nThere\\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\\n\\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\\n\\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\\nvalue; it\\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\\n\\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\\n\\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\\n\\n\\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\\n\\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\\nstandards organizations.\\n\\nSince we can\\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren\\'t compatible with\\nanybody else\\'s.\\n\\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\\nthat\\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\\n    pixels and not much else.\\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the\\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\\nof JPEG-related products; it\\'s reasonably likely that future commercial\\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\\n\\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\\n\\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\\'s QuickTime\\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\\n\\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software\\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\\n\\n\\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\\n\\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\\'t read, it\\'s likely\\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\\n\\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \\'JFIF\\'.\\n\\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\\n    it\\'s worth a try, anyway.\\n\\n3.  HSI files start with \\'hsi1\\'.  You\\'re out of luck unless you have HSI\\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\\n    won\\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\\n\\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \\'JFIF\\').  Strip off\\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\\n\\n5.  Anything else: it\\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\\n    try stripping off everything before that.\\n\\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM_]C_X ...\\n\\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM:\\'-I ...\\n\\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\\n\\n\\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\\n\\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\\nat best.)\\n\\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn\\'t great enough to justify the\\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\\n\\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\\n\\n\\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\\n\\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\\nfirst time around.\\n\\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\\nfree JPEG software.  It\\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\\n\\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\\n(If you\\'re wondering why, it\\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move.\\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\\nthat\\'s a mighty limited capability!)\\n\\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\\ntransmission of images, but you don\\'t want to use it as an intermediate\\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\\n\\n\\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\\n\\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it\\'s far better to make a JPEG from\\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\\nloss of quality.\\n\\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\\ndon\\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\\n\\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\\nDon\\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\\'t\\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\\n\\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\\nsystem, XV\\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\\nway to do this.)\\n\\ncjpeg\\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\\n\\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\\ncolor noise; and JPEG can\\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\\nthan you\\'d get without smoothing.\\n\\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\\nthe output image, which you don\\'t want.  If you are an image processing\\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\\'s built-in smoother is\\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\\n\\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\\nimage, you\\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\\n\\n-- \\n\\t\\t\\ttom lane\\n\\t\\t\\torganizer, Independent JPEG Group\\nInternet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu\\tBITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie\\n',\n",

(Due to the prevailing assumption \\nthat the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)\\n\\n  The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the \\ndevelopment of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications \\nof BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!\\n\\n  REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!\\n\\n  \\n1\\n  I dream like this: ether based reality\\n \\n  The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations \\nstart as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the lattices\\nboth drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it, \\nconverting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy. \\n(non-spinning lattice = \"dark matter\")\\n\\n  The earth isn\\'t exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image \\nof a galaxy; we haven\\'t any videos of them spinning. Picture us \\nbeing stationary, and the sun\\'s image being dragged across the sky by \\nthe spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is \\nspinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner \\nkernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a \\nfaster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground \\nof the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but \\nits \"foot print\" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])\\n  \\n  The moon isn\\'t exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self \\nspin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth\\'s ether field, which is \\nitself in the sun\\'s much more powerful field. Our seasons are the \\nwobble of earth\\'s axis, like a top slowing down. The \"orbit\" of the\\nearth around the sun is all of the stars\\' images being dragged around\\nby the sun\\'s ether feild.\\n\\n  The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and \"distance\" \\napart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because \\nthe \"path\" is not the same. The moon\\'s lattice in the ether is like \\nsticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half \\nturn. The sun\\'s lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has \\ngot the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to \\nthe moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a \"j\" hook at \\nthe end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the \\nwhole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there. \\n\\n  With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon \\ncan be about as big as \"earth\\'s\" shadow upon it, and at other times \\ntotally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge, \\nwould you guess that they are about the same size, just because they \\nlook about the same size?\\n\\n   O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S\\n E       /     \\\\            \\n    M    |      |      OR                M    \\n         \\\\ _ _ /                         \\n       S                           \\n       \\n  The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate\\nof ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating \"turntable view\" \\nof the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( I\\'ve seen a \\nhalf moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the \\nday. Try and draw that \"earth shadow.\") Its only the moon\\'s image \\nwhich appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is \\nthe part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away \\nfrom the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.\\n\\n  \"Light-Years\" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is \\ncloser to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase \\nof reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion. \\n(defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be \\nessentially happening now. The \"piece\" of light may have experienced \\nmany years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.\\n\\n  To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to \\nde-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design \\na propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like \\ntrying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)\\n\\n  To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I\\'d \\nlook in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just \\nmight carry decipherable data. I\\'d start looking on some part of the \\nspectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+ \\nbillion humans?) I\\'d totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG \\nbackwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card \\nfor Pentium!)\\n\\n  Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound \\nmedia, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I \\nwould try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which \\nI\\'d start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole. \\n[Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a \\ntwo foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I \\ncould get with my machine\\'s receiver next to it.  \\n\\n  If you don\\'t think you\\'ll live to see it, consider this: QUIT \\nPUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of \\nlife\\'s data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our \\nthoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By \\neating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant \\ninstructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or \\nbiblical guys did live hundreds of years. I\\'m curios to see what \\nthey did and ate. Don\\'t worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we \\ndon\\'t need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and \\nthat is creating matter! I only need enough to bounce around. Where \\ndid the household concept \\'immortal\\' come from? Wheat is a weed, it \\nis programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then \\ndie)\\n\\n  Warning about writing to the past:\\nI had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel \\nfuture, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from. \\nThere were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an \\nOscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us, \\nand then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the \\nothers into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by \\n\"advising\" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into \\nreproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that \\nthe little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to \\nprovide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it \\nin his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his \\ncontrol. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying \\nthat there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve \\nsouls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was \\nfinite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in \\nour reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it \\nseemed odd, but we couldn\\'t remember how else it should be. Then \\nsome of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no \\nmore, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped \\nthrough his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that \\nhe had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body, \\nexisting only on the wind. \\n\\n  MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls \\nwhose will\\'s are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat \\nothers as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a \\nlonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for \\nplaymates. (its not eternal, there\\'s more than one way back) \\n\\n Accepting rides to the past:\\nOnce here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a \\nPrince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go \\nahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry. \\nI Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes \\nyour work, but thinks you\\'re getting wise, he can direct you to cross \\npaths with your old self, and you\\'ll vanish as you rewrite your own \\ncourse of history, none the wiser.\\n\\n  As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped \\nback in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still \\nmake changes while he\\'s here, its just that that is work, and with \\nevery \\'adjustment\\', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which \\nloosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less. \\nBut he can\\'t see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had \\nto apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand \\nto retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers. \\n\\n  How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country, \\nour money, and they\\'re spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this: \\nWashington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to \\ncongress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks \\nare making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big \\ncorporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the \\nbanks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but \\nmostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14 \\nhours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time \\nto buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If \\nwe are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if \\nthe point is just to keep the people busy making widgets? \\n\\n  In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, \"its chaos!\" They \\nsaid, \"no, its order.\" He defined chaos as that which is he was not \\nable to control.\\n\\n  Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy \\nwould hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no \\nlanguage. (telepathic; and \\'vanishing\\' the closest knowledge of death)\\n(think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and \\npointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably \\nnaive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should \\nbe able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about. \\nThey can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers \\nmight have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a \\ndifferent frequency than us as they aren\\'t eating seeds.\\n\\n  Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a \\nhuge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat \\nonly fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and \\nneed a lot less sleep.\\n\\n  UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over. The \\ntroops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its OK to kill \\neach other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)\\n\\n  Somalia: What is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot \\ntall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they \\nsuck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that \\nthey aren\\'t dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life. \\n\\n  Women with children, Babes in arms: Historical references to women \\nand children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut \\nfrom the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) I think \\nthat there may be some very interesting results to this, such as \\nmother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. There are examples \\nof this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.\\n\\n  That guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar. He \\ntells it first, and then just follows the thread of time in which \\nthe people are willing to buy it. (in which he can make it so) He\\'ll \\nplay a poker face up until he thinks he\\'s cornered, and then he\\'ll \\nwhine, beg and grovel. All it means to him is that you\\'re willing to \\nlive on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was \\nright, and he didn\\'t over play his hand, and he won\\'t need to go \\nback and try another thread of time. You have ultimate control over \\nyour destiny, just don\\'t live along a path that leads to a reality \\nin which you don\\'t want to be a part of. \\n\\n  I don\\'t claim to be the first to think these things, its just \\nthat the others could have been \\'pruned\\' from our path. Maybe these \\nthoughts given to me were laid down on the track of time, after him.\\n\\n  \\n \\n',\n",

It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in,\\ntherefore the theoretical height for a constant section column\\nthat can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft,\\nor 75 Statute miles.\\n\\nNow, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss\\ntype, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength.\\nLet us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical \\nstrength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant\\nsection column.  \\n\\nA constant section column is not the limit on how high you can\\nbuild something if you allow a tapering of the cross section\\nas you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound\\nload to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in\\ncalculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross\\nsectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure\\nbelow the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile \\nbelow the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.\\n\\nThe next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section\\nto support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile\\nof structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way\\nto the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical\\nlimit on area, although there will be practical limits based\\non how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how\\nmuch load you need to support on the ground (for which you need\\na foundation that the bedrock can support.\\n\\nLet us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction\\ncost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites,\\nassuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  The $40/lb figure\\nis just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload mass\\nratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the tower\\nheight becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significant\\natmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still\\nhave to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses\\nwill be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of\\nrocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity,\\nbut which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus\\nthey represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets starting\\nfrom the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.\\n\\nThis analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind\\nloads.  These will require more structural support over the first\\n15 miles of height.  Above that, the air pressure drops to a low\\nenough value for it not to be a big factor.\\n\\nDani Eder\\n\\n-- \\nDani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/\\nRt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.\\n\",\n",

Remember from stellar evolution that \\nblack holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars,\\nM(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, taking\\nappoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time,\\nthey don\\'t live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so any\\nof these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB\\'s) will be in the plane of the\\ngalaxy.  \\n        Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the\\nvarious satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, either\\nPion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on our\\ncatalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropic\\ndistribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs of\\nhomogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we are\\nsampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE.\\nNot cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, I\\nsuppose you are saying, \"Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside the\\ndisk.\"  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less an\\ninterplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out\\nto beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors de\\ntect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here\\'s an \\nanalogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane from\\nthe origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mile\\naway sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of his\\narbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different,\\nand you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybe\\nfind a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.  \\n        I should throw in why halo, and corona models don\\'t work, also.  As I\\nsaid before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (short\\ntimescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type of\\nbehavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be bound\\nto the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources.\\nWhen you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk,\\nbut you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely see\\nnot only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources \\nin the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before, there is none of\\nthese characteristics.  \\n        \\n        I think that\\'s all of it...if someone needs clarification, or knows\\nsomething that I don\\'t know, by all means correct me.  I had the honor of\\ntaking the Bursts class with the person who has done the modeling of these\\ndifferent distributions, so we pretty much kicked around every possible\\ndistribution there was, and some VERY outrageous sources. Colliding pulsars,\\nblack holes, pulsars that are slowing down...stuff like that.   It\\'s a fun\\nfield. \\n        Complaints and corrections to: belgarath@vax1.mankato.msus.edu or \\npost here.  \\n                                                        -jeremy\\n\\n        \\n',\n",

The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.\\n\\n   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:\\n\\n    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)\\n\\n    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)\\n\\n    o User Interface Panels\\n\\n    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for\\n\\tfaster frame rates)\\n\\n    o Mouse and Keyboard Input\\n\\n   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the\\n   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because\\n   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)\\n\\n  Server(s):\\n   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is\\n   provided in this release for potential world server developers:\\n\\n    o Transparent Client Management\\n\\n    o Client Message Handling\\n\\n   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of\\naccepting and\\n   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the\\napplication writer\\n   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.\\n\\n   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is\\n   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:\\n\\n    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:\\n        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended\\n        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension\\n        initialisers you want.\\n\\n    o Event Handler Registration:\\n        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback\\n        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.\\n        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)\\n\\n    o Collision Detection Registration:\\n        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide\\n        some basic information to the collision detection management software.\\n        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.\\n\\n    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because\\n    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects\\n    from which to choose.\\n\\n    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:\\n\\n    o Provide an initWorld function:\\n        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus\\n        any initialization you want to do.\\n\\n    o Provide a positionObject function:\\n        This is where you determine where to place a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:\\n        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide a getWorldType function:\\n        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.\\n\\n    o Provide an animateWorld function:\\n        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects\\n        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit\\n        (to avoid outrunning the clients).\\n\\n    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the\\n    three world servers I've provided:\\n\\n        generic - 81 lines\\n        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the\\n                           stairs!

Anyone care to clue me in?\\n\\nThis is a rating system used by ARPA and other organisations to\\nmeasure the maturity of a `software process' i.e. the entire process\\nby which software gets designed, written, tested, delivered, supported\\netc.\\n\\nSee `Managing the Software Process', by Watts S. Humphrey, Addison\\nWesley 1989. An excellent software engineering text. The 5 levels of\\nsoftware process maturity are:\\n\\n1. Initial\\n2. Repeatable\\n3. Defined\\n4. Managed\\n5. Optimizing\\n\\nThe levels are approximately characterized as follows:\\n\\n1. no statistically software process control. Have no statistical\\n   basis for estimating how large software will be, how long it will\\n   take to produce, how expensive it will be, or how reliable it will\\n   be.  Most software production is at this level.\\n\\n2. stable process with statistical controls, rigorous project\\n   management; having done something once, can do it again. Projects\\n   are planned in detail, and there is software configuration\\n   management and quality assurance.\\n\\n3. The process is defined and understood, implementation is\\n   consistent. This includes things like software inspection, a\\n   rigorous software testing framework, more configuration management,\\n   and typically a `software engineering process group' within the\\n   project.\\n\\n4. Statistical information on the software is systematically gathered\\n   and analysed, and the process is controlled on the basis of this\\n   information. Software quality is measured and has goals.\\n\\n5. Defects are prevented, the process is automated, software contracts\\n   are effective and certified.\\n\\nNick Haines nickh@cmu.edu\\n\",\n",

That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,\\n   but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing\\n   military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than\\n   just a \"we have the money, why not?\" approach.\\n\\nAh, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not\\nwasted on the moon. It\\'s not like they\\'d be using $1000 (1000R?) bills\\nto fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would be\\nspent in the country to which the base belonged. It\\'s a way of funding\\nhigh-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various\\nfields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the\\ndefense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to\\nfund research, under the pretense that it\\'s good for pan-European\\ncooperation.\\n\\nNow maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of\\nmoney (in fact, I\\'m pretty sure you do), but it does count as\\ninvestment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look at\\nthe size of that multiplier :->).\\n\\nNick Haines nickh@cmu.edu\\n',\n",

This\\nsummarises the general conclusions of 135 speakers and 300\\nparticipants at the Conference on Olympus Utilisation held in\\nSeville on 20-22-April 1993. The conference was organised by\\nthe European Space Agency (ESA) and the Spanish Centre for\\nthe Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI).\\n\\nOLYMPUS has been particularly useful :\\n-      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of\\n       new users, thanks to satellite terminals with very small\\n       antennas (VSATs). OLYMPUS experiments have tested\\n       data transmission, videoconferencing, business television,\\n       distance teaching and rural telephony, to give but a few\\n       examples.\\n\\n-      in opening the door to new telecommunications services\\n       which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower-\\n       frequency bands; OLYMPUS was the first satellite over\\n       Europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 GHz band.\\n\\n-      in establishing two-way data relay links  OLYMPUS\\n       received for the first time in Europe, over several months,\\n       high-volume data from a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and\\n       then distributed it to various centres in Europe.\\n\\nWhen OLYMPUS was launched on 12 July 1989 it was the\\nworld\\'s largest telecommunications satellite; and no other\\nsatellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining four\\ndifferent payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands.\\n\\nOLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to some\\nof the world\\'s largest businesses. Access to the satellite is\\ngiven in order to test new telecommunications techniques or\\nservices; over the past four years some 200 companies and\\norganisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over\\n100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learning\\norganisation.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the new technologies and services tested by these\\nOLYMPUS users enter the commercial market, they then\\nmake use of operational satellites such as those of\\nEUTELSAT.\\n\\nOLYMPUS utilisation will continue through 1993 and 1994,\\nwhen the spacecraft will run out of fuel as it approaches the\\nend of its design life.\\n\\n       \\n',\n",

Bussard, Journal of\\n\\tPropulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990\\n\\n\\t    Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion\\n\\t    systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the\\n\\t    thrust-power \"gain\" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values\\n\\t    of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are\\n\\t    always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, \"high-thrust\"\\n\\t    interplanetary flight is not possible, because system\\n\\t    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local\\n\\t    gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100\\n\\t    times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer\\n\\t    \"high-thrust\" flight capability. One performance example shows a\\n\\t    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with\\n\\t    19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows\\n\\t    the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in\\n\\t    Earth/moon space.\\n\\n\\t\"The QED Engine System: Direct Electric Fusion-Powered Systems for\\n\\tAerospace Flight Propulsion\" by Robert W.

Let's do it right this\\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\\n\\n[1] microgravity/vacuum process research\\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \\n\\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \\ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \\ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \\nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \\nconstellation.  \\n\\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \\nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\\n\\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\\n\\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \\non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \\ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \\nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \\nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\\n\\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\\nare spent on astronauts.\\n\\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \\nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\\n\\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \\nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\\norbits.\\n\\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \\nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \\nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\\n\\n\\n-- \\nNick Szabo\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t szabo@techboook.com\\n\",\n",

Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.\\n\\nGrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-\\nline/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.\\n\\nGrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel\\nprojections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showing\\noff for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain\\nwhat it all means later on). \\n\\nGrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with\\ndata so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines\\nto do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so\\nyou don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)\\n\\nGrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above \\nprocessors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac.\\nBoth versions are *100% source compatibel*. \\n\\nGrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D\\ngraphics and how to use the package.\\n\\nIf demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library. \\nHowever, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for\\na lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.\\n\\nGrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage.

I kind of like the convenience of having one big forum\\nfor discussing all aspects of graphics.  Anyone else feel this way?\\nJust curious.\\n\\n\\nDaemon\\n\\n',\n",

Final responsibility for\\nthe success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadership\\nand responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set up\\nas Reston is.

On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquire\\ncelestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2)\\nswing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.\\n\\n2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked\\nto the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activity\\nfrom April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay\\nAntenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to\\n11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.\\n\\n3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss\\ntimer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\\n\\n4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\\nproperly.\\n\\n5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify\\nthe health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment\\ndata; long term trend analysis is continuing.\\n\\n6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the\\noptimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminary\\nanalysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation\\nindex is near the optimal level.\\n\\n7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.\\nPreliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.\\n\\n8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster\\nflushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed\\nduring the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.\\n\\n9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant\\nchanges (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads\\n19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  These\\nmeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special\\nanomaly team.\\n\\n10. The Spacecraft status as of April 15, 1993, is as follows:\\n\\n       a)  System Power Margin -  60 watts\\n       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin\\n       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner\\n       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees\\n           off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading)\\n       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1\\n       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range\\n       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,\\n           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS\\n       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours\\n           Time To Initiation - 260 hours\\n\\n\\nGDS (Ground Data Systems):\\n\\n1.  Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test\\nfor the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21\\n(Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify\\nthe flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller\\n(TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement\\nfor the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry\\nrates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry\\nSubsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The\\n10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was\\nnot metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS\\ndata from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) of\\nthe TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993.\\n\\n\\nTRAJECTORY\\n\\n     As of noon Thursday, April 15, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory\\nstatus was as follows:\\n\\n\\tDistance from Earth         152,606,000 km (1.02 AU)\\n\\tDistance from Sun           277,519,800 km (1.86 AU)\\n\\tHeliocentric Speed          93,400 km per hour\\n\\tDistance from Jupiter       543,973,900 km\\n\\tRound Trip Light Time       17 minutes, 4 seconds\\n\\n\\nSPECIAL TOPIC\\n\\n1.

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design\\n    team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.\\n\\n\\n    ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into\\n    Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20\\n    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas\\n    scintillation proportional counters.\\n\\n\\n    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint\\n    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian\\n    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini\\n    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.\\n    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA\\n    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon\\n    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\\n    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens\\n    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\\n    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours\\n    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\\n    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter\\n    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan\\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and\\n    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the\\n    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn\\'s atmosphere,\\n    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn\\'s\\n    satellites, and characterize Titan\\'s atmosphere and surface.\\n\\n    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its\\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These\\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\\n    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\\n    peer through Titan\\'s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\\n    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.\\n\\n    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the\\n    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of\\n    Saturn\\'s satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan\\n    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan\\n    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true\\n    nature of Saturn\\'s rings.\\n\\n\\t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory)\\n\\t -------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\t   10/06/97 - Titan IV/Centaur Launch\\n\\t   04/21/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist\\n\\t   06/20/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist\\n\\t   08/16/99 - Earth Gravity Assist\\n\\t   12/30/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist\\n\\t   06/25/04 - Saturn Arrival\\n\\t   01/09/05 - Titan Probe Release\\n\\t   01/30/05 - Titan Probe Entry\\n\\t   06/25/08 - End of Primary Mission\\n\\t    (Schedule last updated 7/22/92)\\n\\n\\n    GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit.

The satellite also\\n    will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.\\n\\n\\n    ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over\\n    its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields\\n    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for\\n    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.\\n\\n    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of\\n    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from\\n    that planet by sliding over Jupiter\\'s north pole in a gravity-assist\\n    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted\\n    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun\\'s south pole\\n    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its\\n    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that\\'s right, a solar-studies spacecraft\\n    that\\'s always further from the Sun than the Earth is!\\n\\n    While in Jupiter\\'s neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and\\n    radiation environment.

In addition, many stand alone\\nunderwater training \"runs\" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.\\n\\n\\tVarious refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be\\nmade based on actual training experience during the months prior to the\\nmission.

I\\'ve typed it in verbatim, for you\\nfolks to chew over. Many of the topics recently\\ndiscussed on sci.space are covered in this.\\n\\nGibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance\\n\\nDr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and\\nTechnology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of\\nthe Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space\\nStation on April 3, three budget options as guidance to\\nthe committee in their deliberations on the redesign of\\nthe space station.\\n\\nA low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7\\nbillion and a high option of $9 billion will be\\nconsidered by the committee. Each option would cover\\nthe total expenditures for space station from fiscal\\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for\\ndevelopment, operations, utilization, Shuttle\\nintegration, facilities, research operations support,\\ntransition cost and also must include adequate program\\nreserves to insure program implementation within the\\navailable funds.\\n\\nOver the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within\\nthe NASA budget for the President\\'s new technology\\ninvestment. As a result, station options above $7\\nbillion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in\\nthe rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space\\nstation option of $9 billion would require $2 billion\\nin offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.\\n\\nGibbons presented the information at an organizational\\nsession of the advisory committee. Generally, the\\nmembers-designate focused upon administrative topics\\nand used the session to get acquainted. They also\\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation\\non the process the Station Redesign Team is following\\nto develop options for the advisory committee to\\nconsider.\\n\\nGibbons also announced that the United States and its\\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and\\nCanadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give\\n\"full consideration\" to use of Russian assets in the\\ncourse of the space station redesign process.\\n\\nTo that end, the Russians will be asked to participate\\nin the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting\\nbasis, so that the redesign team can make use of their\\nexpertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the\\npossible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and\\nsystems. The U.S. and international partners hope to\\nbenefit from the expertise of the Russian participants\\nin assessing Russian systems and technology. The\\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop\\noptions for reducing station costs while preserving key\\nresearch and exploration capabilities. Careful\\nintegration of Russian assets could be a key factor in\\nachieving that goal.\\n\\nGibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is\\ncommitted to the redesigned space station and to making\\nevery effort to preserve the science, the technology\\nand the jobs that the space station program represents.\\nHowever, he also is committed to a space station that\\nis well managed and one that does not consume the\\nnational resources which should be used to invest in\\nthe future of this industry and this nation.\"\\n\\nNASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin said the Russian\\nparticipation will be accomplished through the East-\\nWest Space Science Center at the University of Maryland\\nunder the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.\\n\\n',\n",

On the drawing you have a set of\\nreference points whose true x,y positions are known.  \\n\\nNow you digitize the drawing manually (in this case, using Yaron\\nDanon\\'s excellent Digitize program).  That is, you use a program which\\nconverts cursor positions to x,y and saves those values when you click\\nthe mouse.\\n\\nUpon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come\\nout of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways\\nfrom the known true values.  This is understandable because the\\nscanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are\\nsuccessive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and\\ncontraction of paper, errors introduced in the printing process,\\nscanner errors and what have you.\\n\\nThe errors are not uniform over the entire drawing, so \"global\"\\nadjustments such as stretching/contracting uniformly over x or y, or\\nrotating the whole drawing, are not satisfactory.\\n\\nSo the question is: does any kind soul know of an algorithm for\\nremoving such distortion?

On April 19, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\\nproperly.\\n\\n2.  On April 19, a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio (CDUSNR) test\\nand a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control (RFSAGC) test were\\nperformed using the LGA-1 (Low Gain Antenna #1) over DSS-63 (Madrid 70 meter\\nantenna) and DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna), respectively.  Data analysis\\nis in process.  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailed\\ninformation relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.\\n\\n3.  On April 19, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to\\n264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\\n\\n4.  On April 21, the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN (Deep Space Network)\\nadvanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 (Goldstone\\n70 meter antenna).  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees\\nto 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.\\n\\n5.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change\\n(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance\\nmeasurement has.  The AC measurement reads 20 DN (4.5 volts).  The DC\\nmeasurement has ranged from 43 DN (4.6 volts) to 138 DN (16.2 volts) and\\ncurrently reads 138 DN (16.2 volts).

As published in \"US Industrial Outlook 1993\" \\n(which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space \\nbusiness are currently projected to be about $4,890 M. \\n   In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had \\nshown double digits growth rates, this year\\'s projected results are \\ndriven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are \\nprojected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7 \\nsatellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also \\nprojects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, \\nand while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to \\n$450 M, future sales will be \"adversely affected by the downward \\nrevision in Department of Defense launch plans.\"                           \\n   Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, \\nrevenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to \\nincrease to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from \\nbroadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products \\nand sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%). \\n\\n US COMMERCIAL SPACE REVENUES     1989  1990   1991 1992(r) 1993(e)\\n Commercial satellites             900 1,000  1,100  1,300     670\\n Satellite services                750   800  1,200  1,500   1,900\\n   Fixed                          (700) (735)(1,115)(1,275) (1,520)\\n   Mobile                          (50) ( 65)(   85)(  225) (  380)\\n Satellite ground equip            790   860  1,350  1,400   1,560\\n   Mobile equipment                (40)  (85)  (280)  (352)    ???\\n Commercial launches               150   570    380    450     450\\n Remote sensing data and services  125   155    190    215     250\\n Private microgravity research lab  --    --     --     --      60\\n                                 ===== =====  ======  =====   =====\\n   TOTAL ANNUAL REVENUES         2,715 3,385   4,220  4,815   4,890\\n        (r) = revised data for 1992   (e) = estimated data for 1993\\n   [Commentary: This is the first look at how the US commercial \\nspace industry is expected to do in 1993.  In general, not a bad \\nreport -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite \\nmanufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth \\n$100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual \\nprojection.  If we look forward over several years, this market \\nsector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very \\nsuccessful in regaining international market share in the satellite \\nbusiness. \\n   Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in \\nthe next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-\\nyear.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including \\nsuch items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals) \\nappears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually \\npublishes a listing of  \"Space Business Indicators\" in mid-year, and \\nthe next revision of commercial space revenues should be released \\nthen.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if \\nthe mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the \\nnumbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth. \\n   Looking beyond this year\\'s data, future markets look quite \\npromising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top \\n$3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct \\nbroadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite \\nstation sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year \\nthrough the mid 1990\\'s.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic \\nfor near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for \\nsubstantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the \\nnext 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative \\nassumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and \\nsatellite direct broadcasting services.  I don\\'t believe all of the \\ncurrent players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite \\nmarket and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will \\nbe financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive \\nas currently projected.) \\n   It should also be noted this year\\'s DoC data is the first \\nrelease to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research \\nfacilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for \\nthe Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space \\nShuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first \\nsales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] \\n\\n2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS\\n   McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta \\nlaunch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola \\nInc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to \\nlaunch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO \\ncommunications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas \\nwas awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract. \\n   The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium \\nconstellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium \\nsatellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be \\nlaunched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle \\nlaunches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be \\nlaunched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.  \\nAdditional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a \\nplanned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although \\ndetails of the launch services contract were reported to be \\nnegotiation, and not yet final. \\n   The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of \\ntheir Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5 \\nmillion, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 \\nlaunches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These \\nlaunches will deploy the next generation of the USAF\\'s Global \\nPositioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other \\nprograms.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is \\nexpected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected \\nto request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.  \\nUnder this contract the USAF can also request \"launch on demand\" \\nservices from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to \\noccur within 40 days of the request. \\n    [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should \\nprovide an excellent business base for MDC\\'s Delta launch program \\nthrough the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have \\na potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and \\nsustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts \\nfor international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA \\nMedium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping \\nMDC as a viable commerical launch company. \\n    However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these \\ncontracts.  Motorola\\'s Iridium LEO communications constellation has \\nnot yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for \\noperation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing \\nand financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these \\napprovals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.  \\nBut, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year. \\n   Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of \\nseveral Congressional actions which have slowed the production of \\nthe GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III \\nprogram in favor of the USAF NLS/\"Spacelifter\" program.  At this \\ntime, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future \\nfunding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts \\nis being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy \\nreviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and \\nCongress propose cancellation of all \"ELV upgrade\" programs \\n(including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed \"Spacelifter\" \\nprogram.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year\\'s budget \\ndeliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to \\nfind in the shrinking US Defense budget.] \\n \\n3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC \"GO-AHEAD\"\\n   The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing \\nsatellite was approved in early February by the US Department of \\nCommerce\\'s Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to \\nWorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and \\noperate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral \\nimages of the Earth. \\n   [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture \\nby WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the \\noperating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the \\nrequest of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new \\nventure as a \"Star Wars\" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to \\nprovide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into \\ndigital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable \\ncustomers for this service include exploration geologists, \\nagricultural planners, and urban planners.  \\n   It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the \\n1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last \\nNovember, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote \\nsensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to \\nthis act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to \\nall users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures \\nwould have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices. \\n   There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote \\nsensing ventures working their way through the system at different \\nstages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite \\nsystems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing \\ndata market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, \\ngovernment-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures \\nsuch as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use \\ninnovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the \\nmargin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures \\nappearing in the next year or so.] \\n                 \\n4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD\\'S SPACE BIZ \"STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT\" \\n   Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General \\nDynamic\\'s Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker, \\ndespite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent \\nanalyst\\'s report Morgan Stanley said \"We are more than ever \\nconvinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical \\n95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-\\ngenerating unit.\"  Based upon discussions with GD\\'s corporate \\nmanagement, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are \\ncleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and \\n$100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD\\'s projection of \\ncapturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market. \\n   [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has \\nhurt General Dynamic\\'s Space Systems Division.  Since GD has \\nrestructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, \\nmany market pundits have been speculating GD\\'s space business might \\nbe next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD\\'s Space \\nSystems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current \\nproblems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected \\nto be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of \\nabout $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space \\nlaunch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability \\nof their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits \\nfrom those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur \\nprogram is back on track, this division will continue to show \\nsubstantial losses. \\n   In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation \\nis not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  \\nTo do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional \\nmanagement would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.  \\nIn GD SSD\\'s case, to get the division back on track, the management \\nteam will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with \\nthe Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would \\nindicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch \\noperations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince \\ncustomers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would \\nhave substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in \\nmarketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for \\nthis might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly \\nMcDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash \\nflow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction \\n(Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), \\nor have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the \\n$700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of \\nchange for any company.] \\n \\n5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND\\n   Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is \\nprojecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990\\'s.  In early \\nFebruary, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which \\ndetailed their projection of the space transportation market for the \\nnext decade. \\n   Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant \\nposition and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54 \\ninternational and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane \\nholds contracts for 31, General Dynamics\\' Atlas vehicle holds 14 \\ncontracts, McDonnell Douglas\\' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall\\'s Long \\nMarch vehicle holds 2 launch contracts. \\n   Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can \\ncompete are projected to come from communications satellites with \\nthe remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and \\nscientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand \\ngrowth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region. \\n   Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of \\nindividual satellite operators into regional or national groups will \\ncontinue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with \\nlarger communications payloads carrying more transponders. \\nArianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications \\nsatellites should increase by 20 % over today\\'s average level, to \\nabout 3000 kg in GEO. \\n   Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain \\nstrong over the next three years, but in the second half of the \\ndecade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace \\nbases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder \\ndemand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques \\nappear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing \\nor near-term transponders. \\n   One of the significant possible changes in the market was \\nidentified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian \\nlaunch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term, \\ninvestors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade \\noff between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and \\nother new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities \\nand service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal. \\n   [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and \\nI reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.  \\nComparing the two surveys, there aren\\'t outstanding differences in \\nthe numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new \\ndata compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical \\ntransponders on orbit.\\n   I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-\\nbased communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While \\nfiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the \\nestablished point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing \\ndemand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-\\nmultipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space \\ntransponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability \\nservice, but only from established point A to established point B. \\nTo establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable \\nbetween the points, and while there are improved network solutions, \\ninstalling a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost \\nmillions or billions of dollars.  \\n   For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground \\nnetwork structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective \\nsolution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is \\ncheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of \\nthousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite \\nnetwork.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and \\nhas kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is \\ngrowing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, \\nit becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to \\nhandle the increase in traffic. \\n   Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still \\ngrowing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But \\nsatellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current \\ngeneration satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of \\non-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from \\nlast generation\\'s satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch \\ndemand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite \\nlaunches over longer intervals. \\n   And as last note; Arianespace didn\\'t flag it this year, but it \\nlooks like the space transportation market will be rather over-\\nsupplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual \\ncommercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites \\nper year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up \\nto about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of \\nabout 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, \\nJapan\\'s H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia\\'s Proton capable of 8, and other \\nsystems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per \\nyear.  That\\'s a lot of capability for a small market. \\n   We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial \\nlaunches.]\\n\\n6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT \\n   The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has \\nspawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety \\nrules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt \\nthe mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation \\nof range safety rules.  \\n   In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of \\ntwo abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure \\ntypically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at \\nWallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute \\nbefore the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was \\noverridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the \\ncommunications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the \\nvalid abort call. \\n   Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort \\ncommand receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an \\ninvestigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to \\nlaunch constraint rules, and was not obeyed. \\n   Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety \\nBoard (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This \\ninvestigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an \\nincident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their \\ninvestigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at \\nlines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used \\nin the launch. \\n  [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an \\ninvestigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested \\nby the Department of Commerce\\'s Office of Commercial Space \\nTransportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.  \\n   At the time of writing this column, some of the initial \\ninvestigations have been concluded, and some of the results are \\nstarting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four \\ndifferent communications channels were in use during the test. After \\nthe abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test \\ndirector and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops \\nIsland gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.  \\nAccording to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. \\nSomehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the \\nNASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying \\nthe Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing \\nexplainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the \\nbest set being that clear lines of communications and clear \\ndefinition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and \\nunderstanding of the mission rules were not established before the \\nlaunch.  \\n   As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these \\nprocedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.   \\nThis case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has \\nbeen called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they \\ndo with commercial aircraft problems).  \\n   I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with \\nprocedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance \\nof guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how \\nspecific lines of authority should be delineated.] \\n\\n7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED\\n   Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new \\nsmall space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.  \\nTwo versions of the launcher are being marketed: the \"Aerokosmos\" \\nwinged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the \"Severkosmos\", \\nlaunched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is \\nprojected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to \\nan 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 \\nkg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used \\nwith these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called \\n\\'Sineva\\'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military \\nestablishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of \\nspacecraft and which has participated in the development of the \\nBuran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia \\nfacility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow. \\n   [Commentary: There\\'s very little released information on this new \\nventure.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking \\nfor hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house \\nknowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous \\ncommercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union. \\n   This one\\'s a little different in that they are offering variants \\nof ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can\\'t identify any key customers being \\ntargeted or substantial financial backing.]\\n\\n8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING\\n   In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the \\nresults of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial \\nrocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland \\nMissile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary \\nstudy recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch \\nsite, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected \\nlow investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic \\nconsiderations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal \\nfor other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses. \\n   [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the \\nKingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still \\nproceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland \\nfound without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if \\nsubstantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected \\nreturns were too low to justify the cost of development.  \\n   This might point out some key discriminators in judging the \\nfeasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:\\n  - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage \\nsufficient to recover setup costs?\\n  - Is there a market advantage of using the site?\\n  - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?\\n  - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the \\ninvestment?  \\n   Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at \\nWoomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore \\nPlatform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against \\nthese criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying \\non hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]\\n\\n9- SPAIN\\'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING\\n   In one of his last official acts, former President Bush \\nauthorized space technology transfer for several joint space \\nventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed \\nuse of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that \\nregulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch \\nvehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first \\nlaunch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as \\na small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into \\nLEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system, \\nincluding 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.  \\nOriginated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in \\ndevelopment funding, and will use technology from Argentina\\'s Condor \\nlaunch vehicle as well as from the US. \\n   [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity \\nin providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small \\npayloads from European firms or organizations currently use either \\nAriane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.  \\nHowever, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout \\nprogram is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the \\nItalian government and space industry regarding any follow-on \\nsystem).  \\n   This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch \\nsystem.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of \\nsuch a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies \\nhave been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche \\nAerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the \\nSwedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to \\nfind any other European development work with even a rumor of \\nfunding for hardware. \\n   Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the \\nArgentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting \\nrumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space \\nlauncher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled \\nthe country in the 1970\\'s and early 1980\\'s. \\n   What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally \\ntransferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new \\ncivilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de \\nAtividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described \\nas originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket \\nprogram in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German \\nfirms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq \\nin the mid-1980\\'s.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and \\ntested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package \\nlagged that of the propulsion system. \\n   It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first \\nscientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B \\nsatellite will study the Earth\\'s upper atmosphere and includes \\ncooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has \\nyet been selected, but OSC\\'s Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air \\nlaunched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this \\ncontract.] \\n\\n10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP\\n   PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in \\nlate February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract \\nfrom the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro\\'s PA-2 \\nlaunch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar \\nSatellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish \\nSpace Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and \\noffering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According \\nto PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya \\nlaunch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-\\nenclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like \\nthe PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as \"the main \\nalternative rocket supplier\" for the small satellite launch service \\nto be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the \\nSwedish satellite was not specified. \\n   [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and \\nfunding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a \\nsmall, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From \\nPacAstro\\'s literature, the engines designed for the PA-series \\nrockets are built of \"off the shelf\" components based upon the Lunar \\nMOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a \\n225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.  \\n   PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its \\nfirst three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and \\n2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired \\nTRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary \\nengineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder \\nclosely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same \\nbuilding).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering, \\nlaunch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. \\nSumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the \\nboard of directors.  \\n   PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least \\n$550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been \\nsearching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to \\ndesign, build and launch their first set of vehicles. \\n   The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help \\nbring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need \\nmuch more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real \\nhardware.] \\n\\n11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED\\n    In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications \\nventure between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.  \\nAs reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC), \\nheadquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist \\nParty, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China \\nGreat Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional \\ncommunications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite \\nsystem cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the \\nsatellite\\'s communications channels.  \\n   [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the \\nrelease of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid \\nJanuary).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of \\nTaiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg \\nscientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional \\nsatellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has \\nbeen helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530 \\nM) through 2006.  \\n   I haven\\'t been able to establish any relationship between this \\nventure and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.  \\nWhile Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the \\ncurrent Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two \\nseparate sastellite ventures. \\n   The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is \"Asiasat-\\n2\", but I don\\'t thinks this has any relationship with the existing \\nHong Kong-based \"Asiasat\" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and \\nother Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational \\nmodel.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing \\nventure -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to \\nTaiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later \\nsatellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between \\nTaiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture \\nthrough a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to \\nproceed. \\n   In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with \\nsubstantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This \\nis just another indicator to add to the list.] \\n\\n12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES\\n   South Korea\\'s Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently \\nannounced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and \\nanother US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for \\nadvanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been \\nspecifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with \\nmanufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by \\n1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea\\'s \\naerospace technology to the level of the world\\'s top 10 countries by \\n2000.                                 \\n   [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its \\nnational aerospace industry, specifically including space \\nactivities. I\\'m noting this as a flag that potential new players are \\ncoming into the commercial space market. \\n   As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications \\nsatellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 \\non Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide \\ntelevision and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula, \\nsouthwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea. \\n   South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on \\nAriane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US \\n$8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of \\nthis year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely \"made in Korea.\"  \\nUribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-\\nmonitoring micro-satellite. \\n   This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth \\nobservation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System) \\nproject, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean \\ngovernment, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with \\noptical and microwave sensors.\\n   South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel \\nmilitary effort to establish the capabilities for building and \\nlaunching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a \\ngovernment panel had been established to oversee such an effort, \\nfunded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an  \\nexpected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the \\nKorean peninsula.       \\n   In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean \\nis also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing \\naerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is \\noffsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as \\npart of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of \\nconsumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports \\nsatellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has \\nannounced teaming for production of OSC\\'s Orbcomm user terminals.).  \\n   This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.  \\nConsidering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector \\nfor commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a \\nSouth Korean push into space technologies may change the composition \\nof commercial space market there over the next decade.] \\n\\n13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH\\n   As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the \\nresults of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and \\ninvestments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of \\nMarch.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the \\nmarket as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+% \\nof the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a \\ngeneral increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The \\nincrease in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which \\nis a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this \\ntrend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite \\nwell, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms \\nwhich are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its \\nresults in all of 1993.

The article starts with \"A leader\\nof the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned\\nspace station said yesterday the job is tough and may\\nbe impossible.\" O\\'Connor is quoted saying whether it is\\npossible to cut costs that much and still provide for\\nmeaningful research \"is a real question for me.\"\\nO\\'Connor said \"everything is fair game,\" including\\n\"dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the\\naerospace industry, chopping management of the space\\nstation program at some NASA facilities around the\\ncountry, working closely with the Russian space station\\nMir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the\\nmanned space shuttle fleet.\"\\n\\nO\\'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options\\nso far, and they are sorting the serious candidates\\ninto three categories based on cost.\\n\\nThe Post says O\\'Connor described the design derived\\nfrom the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe\\nKathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. I\\nlistened in on part of O\\'Connor\\'s briefing to the press\\non Monday, and in one part of the briefing O\\'Connor\\ntalked about how the White House wants three options,\\nsorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part\\nof the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has\\nformed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC,\\nmodular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single Launch\\nCore [\"wingless Orbiter\"] @ JSC. Later, in response to\\na reporters question, I thought I heard O\\'Connor say\\nthe option based on a SSF redesign was a \"moderate\"\\ncost option, in between low & high cost options. Not\\nthe \"high cost\" option as Sawyer wrote).\\n\\nThe article goes on to describe the other two options\\nas \"one features modules that could gradually be fitted\\ntogether in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. The\\nother is a core facility that could be deposited in\\norbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That option\\nwould use existing hardware from the space shuttle -\\nthe fuselage, for example, in its basic structure.\"\\n\\nThe last sentence in the article contradicts the title\\n& the first paragraph. The sentence reads \"He\\n[O\\'Connor] said a streamlined version of the planned\\nspace station Freedom is still possible within the\\nadministration\\'s budget guidelines.\"\\n\\n',\n",

Mitchell\\n                          March 23, 1993\\n \\nINTRODUCTION:\\n \\nIn order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a\\nreal miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test\\ntele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals\\nlocated world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment\\npurposes.\\nNot only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and\\ntele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of\\ninformation\\non methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of\\na\\nlunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating\\neducational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and\\nachievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in\\nTwenty-First century remote learning methods.\\n \\nBecause of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests\\nand\\nskills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures,\\ninterfacing\\nand electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving\\nplayground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and\\nprofessionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at\\na participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at\\nthe\\nLTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real\\nfacility\\nexists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the\\nconstruction\\nof the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested\\nby the users themselves.\\n \\nThis has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:\\n - tele-operations and virtual reality research\\n - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation\\n - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers\\n - art and theater\\n - bbs and online network users\\n - software and game developers\\n - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains\\n - children\\n - the child in all of us\\n \\nLTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:\\n \\nA room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used\\nfor murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth.\\nThe \"floor\" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions\\nis hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and\\ncreation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and\\nmachine-lets.\\n \\n The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:\\n 1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;\\n 2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and\\n 3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.\\n \\n Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on\\n it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture\\n content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent\\n to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.\\n \\nThe first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains\\nwith TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control\\nelectronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will\\nreceive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their\\ndata link to LTM1.\\n \\nNext, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a\\nservo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the\\nSSTO\\nto be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar\\nlandscape and land.\\n \\nFinally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped\\nbulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators\\nworldwide\\nto receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and\\ntakeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on\\ncommercially\\navailable items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the\\ninterface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced\\nham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.\\n \\nBy taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding\\na tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be\\nprovided in under 80 man hours.\\n \\nPLAN OF ACTION:\\n \\nThe Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by\\nproviding a host computer network and Internet access to that network.\\nDiaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction\\nof the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be\\nmodified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide \"rail stock\"\\nfor the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical\\ncommunications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets.\\nAn initial \"ground breaking\" with miniature shovels will be performed for\\na live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial\\nmodels will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for\\nhistorical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely\\nserious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional\\nbuilding, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and\\nthe photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution\\nworld-wide to major online networks and bbs\\'s. A press release will be\\nissued\\ncalling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale\\nmodels\\nfor the simulated lunar colony.\\n \\nA contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then\\nbe\\nannounced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to\\nfind instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of\\nthe lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that\\ntime\\nthe results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will\\nthen be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return\\nto\\ntheir campus.\\n \\nA monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via\\nconventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment\\naddition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media.\\nHaving a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo\\nopportunity for the television community. Especially since the \"action\"\\nwill\\nbe controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be\\ninvited to issue \"challenges\" to engineering and human factors students at\\nuniversities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform\\nlunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be\\nsimulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.\\n \\nThe long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education,\\nexperimentation\\nand remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a\\nlong\\nterm global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic\\nexample of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited\\nto space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can\\nlead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!\\n \\nCONCLUSION:\\n \\nEduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has\\never enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a\\nglobally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation\\npurposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create\\nworld-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require\\nreal\\n(not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people\\'s minds in\\nspace.\\n \\n \\nMOONLIGHTERS:\\n \\n\"Illuminating the path of knowledge about space and lunar development.\"\\nThe following people are already engaged in various parts of this work:\\nDavid42, Rob47, Dash, Hyson, Jzer0, Vril, Wyatt, The Dark One, Tiggertoo,\\nThe Mad Hatter, Sir Robin, Jogden.\\n \\nCome join the discussion any Friday night from 10:30 to midnight PST in\\n \\nDiaspar Virtual Reality Network.

There is no planet inside of\\nthe orbit of Mercury.\\n\\nThe idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercury\\'s observed\\nperihelion precession and the value it should have had according to\\nNewtonian physics.  Leverrier made an extensive set of observations\\nand calculations during the mid 19th century, and Simon Newcombe later\\nimproved on the observations and re-calculated using Leverrier\\'s system\\nof equations.  Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptune\\nand since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit\\nof Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was\\nafoot with Mercury.\\n\\nBut alas, \\'twere not so.  Mercury\\'s perihelion precesses at the rate\\nit does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly\\ncurved due to the sun\\'s mass.  This explanation had to wait until 1915\\nand Albert Einstein\\'s synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics\\nof moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian \\ngeometry.  The result was the General Theory of Relativity, and one of\\nit\\'s most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precession\\nof Mercury\\'s perihelion almost exactly.  (Exactly if you use Newcomb\\'s\\nnumbers rather than Leverrier\\'s.)\\n\\nOf course not everybody believes Einstein, and that\\'s fine.  But subsequent\\nefforts to find any planets closer to the sun than Mercury using radar\\nhave been fruitless.\\n\\n-Bill Gawne\\n\\n \"Forgive him, he is a barbarian, who thinks the customs of his tribe\\n  are the laws of the universe.\"                       - G.

Observers were\\nstartled this spring when a NASA launch vehicle arrived at the\\npad with \"SCHWARZENEGGER\" painted in huge block letters on the\\nside of the booster rockets.  Space Marketing Inc. had arranged\\nfor the ad to promote Arnold\\'s latest movie. Now, Space Marketing\\nis working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers on\\na plan to place a mile-long inflatable billboard in low-earth\\norbit.  NASA would provide contractual launch services. However,\\nsince NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates\\n(WN 26 Mar 93) the taxpayers would bear most of the expense. This\\nmay look like environmental vandalism, but Mike Lawson, CEO of\\nSpace Marketing, told us yesterday that the real purpose of the\\nproject is to help the environment! The platform will carry ozone\\nmonitors he explained--advertising is just to help defray costs.\\n..........\\n\\nWhat do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize\\nthe night sky? It is not even April 1 anymore.\\nWhat about light pollution in observations?

Massive amounts of regolith would\\nhave to be processed.\\n\\nThis thread reminds me of Wingo\\'s claims some time ago about the moon\\nas a source of titanium for use on earth.  As I recall, Wingo wasn\\'t\\ncontent with being assured that titanium (at .5% in the Earth\\'s crust,\\naverage) would not run out, and touted lunar mines, even though the\\nmarket price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $.06/pound.\\nThis prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources.\\n\\nOn the moon, titanium occurs in basalts; \"high-Ti\" basalts (Apollo 11\\nand 17) have 8-14% titanium dioxide (by weight).  This is nice, but...\\nterrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in\\ntitanium.  They very often have 3% TiO2, frequently have 4%, and\\nsometimes even 5% TiO2 (again, by weight).  These flood basalts are\\n*enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over the\\nworld (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  If\\neven 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2\\nat concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti\\nbasalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon\\ncould be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the\\nore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores being\\nmined today).\\n\\n\\tPaul F.

Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can\\nbe reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at\\nmholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.\\n\\nMark proposed this design, which he calls \"Geode\" (\"rough on the\\noutside, but a gem on the inside\") or the \"ET Strongback with\\nintegrated hab modules and centrifuge.\"  As you can see from file\\ngeodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much\\nof the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The\\nwhite track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte\\nManipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS)\\npod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting\\ncan occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass\\nproperties of the Station change during assembly.\\n\\nThe inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because\\nit can approach closer to the Station\\'s CG and at a structurally strong\\npart of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are\\nlimited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the\\ndocking system.\\n\\nThe ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional\\nlaunch mass.  We\\'ve always had the ability to put an ET into orbit\\n(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we\\'ve never\\nhad a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to\\n(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual\\nde-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the\\nresidual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from\\nimpact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a\\nKevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating\\nthe local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing\\nfurther micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,\\nit supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the\\nnucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.\\n\\nThe white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment\\nGyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used\\nfor gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system\\nwhich can be used at the end of the Station\\'s life to perform a\\ncontrolled de-orbit (so we don\\'t kill any more kangaroos, like we\\ndid with Skylab).\\n\\nThe centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be\\nused for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity\\non humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device\\nfor the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on\\none of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.\\n\\nThis design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical,\\ndata and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work\\ndone to date.\\n\\nMark proposed this design at Joe Shea\\'s committee in Crystal City,\\nand he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors\\nI hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter\\nseems more likely.\\n\\nPlease note that this text is my interpretation of Mark\\'s design;\\nyou should see his notes in the GIF files.  \\n\\nInstead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space, I tried to post these for\\nanon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space.

Schmidt)\\nSubject: outlining of spline surface\\nKeywords: spline rasterization\\nLines: 38\\n\\n\\n\\tAbout a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to\\nbe very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  I am wondering if\\nanyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published \\nsolutions to it.\\n\\n\\tThe problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two\\nroughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially\\nstarts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the \\nedge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant\\nbetween the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw \\nthe object we \\n\\n1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively\\n\\tcomputed as a sequence of line segments approximating the\\n        curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume\\n\\tthat the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not\\n\\texactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable\\n\\tmeasure.\\n2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment\\n\\tof the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two\\n\\ttriangles which will be filled in to color the surface.\\n3) Depth sort the triangles\\n4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw\\n\\tand color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is\\n\\talong the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge\\n\\tcolored with a special \"edge color\"\\n\\n\\tIt is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the\\nproblem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface.\\nThe net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in\\nthe edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated.\\nThey involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting\\nfrom the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem\\nsounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this\\narea.\\n\\n-Thanks\\n',\n",

Features\\n===========\\n\\nDMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC:\\n\\n\\n - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard\\n   (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)\\n\\n - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display\\n\\n - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA)\\n\\n - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale\\n\\n - color-space selection\\n\\n - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required\\n\\n - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic)\\n\\n - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for\\n   VGA and many Super-VGAs\\n\\n...\\n\\n4. Technical information\\n========================\\n\\nThe player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].\\nThe IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2]\\n(not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero\\ncoefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT\\n(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'\\nalgorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main\\ndifference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported\\nalgorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to\\nuse a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation\\ndominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of\\nthe dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).\\n\\nRestricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to\\n+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed\\nover this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points\\nis thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the\\nexpense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.\\n\\nSaturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying\\nsomewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated\\nby primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of\\nconstant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the\\nlower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than\\nto hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve\\non NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish\\nareas.\\n\\n...\\n\\n--\\nStefan Eckart, stefan@lis.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de\\n\",\n",

Reston was the\\nonly place you would find people actually interested in solving the\\nproblems and building a station.\\n\\n>Kinda funny isn\\'t it that someone who talks about a problem like this is\\n>at a place where everything is overhead.\\n\\nWhen you have a bit more experience Dennis, you will realize that\\nintegration isn\\'t overhead. It is the single most important part\\nof a successful large scale effort.\\n\\n>Why did the Space News artice point out that it was the congressionally\\n>demanded change that caused the problems? Methinks that you are being \\n>selective with the facts again.\\n\\nThe story you refer to said that some NASA people blamed it on\\nCongress. Suprise suprise. The fact remains that it is the centers\\nyou support so much who covered up the overheads and wouldn\\'t address\\nthe problems until the press published the story.\\n\\nAre you saying the Reston managers where wrong to get NASA to address\\nthe overruns? You approve of what the centers did to cover up the overruns?\\n\\n>If it takes four flights a year to resupply the station and you have a cost\\n>of 500 million a flight then you pay 2 billion a year.

This merely points out a \\n>blatent contridiction in your numbers that understandably you fail to see.\\n\\nYou should know Dennis that NASA doesn\\'t include transport costs for\\nresuply.

(818) 354-5011\\n\\nContact:  Mary A. Hardin\\n\\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993\\n#1506\\n\\n     Scientists at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the\\nsuccessful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to\\nmeasure and study chemicals in the Earth\\'s ozone layer.\\n\\n     The April 3 flight from California\\'s Barstow/Daggett Airport\\nreached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took\\nmeasurements as part of a program established to correlate data\\nwith the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).  \\n\\n     The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to\\nreadings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy\\n(ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle\\nDiscovery.\\n\\n     \"We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an\\nongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is actively\\ninvolved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three\\nimportant ways,\" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on\\nthe balloon research campaign.  \\n\\n     \"There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,\" he\\ncontinued.  \"The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists,\\nand the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth\\nfor those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own\\nright.\"\\n\\n     The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more\\npieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the\\nmid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. \\nUnderstanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps\\nscientists construct more accurate computer models which are\\ninstrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.\\n\\n     The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL\\ninstruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures\\nozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere;\\na submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave\\nradiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier\\ntransform infrared interferometer which monitors how the\\natmosphere absorbs sunlight. \\n\\n     Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three-\\nhour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130\\nkilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground\\nstations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m.\\nPacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded\\nto separate from the balloon.\\n\\n     \"We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared\\nmeasurements,\" Margitan explained, \"and we also needed to fly in\\ndarkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.\"\\n\\n     It will be several weeks before scientists will have the\\ncompleted results of their experiments.  They will then forward\\ntheir data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space\\nFlight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS\\nscientists.    \\n\\n     The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon\\nFacility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a\\ncontract from NASA\\'s Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was\\nlaunched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction\\nand the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.\\n\\n     The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than\\none-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic\\nmeters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with\\nhelium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh\\nbetween 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The\\nscientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds\\nand is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.\\n\\n     The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA\\'s Upper\\nAtmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements\\nProgram.                        \\n\\n                              #####\\n     ___    _____     ___\\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\\\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\\n    | | | |  __ \\\\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | Being cynical never helps \\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | to correct the situation \\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | and causes more aggravation\\n                                                  | instead.\\n',\n",

If space \\ntravel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as \\nMt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that\\'s a very minor \\nactivity in the global scope of things.\\n\\nLuna has an inconvienent gravity field. It\\'s likely too low to prevent\\ncalcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it\\'s\\ntoo high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories\\nthat can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna\\nhas a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital\\nsites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers\\na source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink,\\nand shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and\\nheavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity\\nwells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.\\n\\nWe don\\'t use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually\\nignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That\\'s because we don\\'t have to\\ndeal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more\\nexpensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we\\'ll use the\\neasier places first.

The first is\\nunlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument.\\nThe second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good\\nenough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for\\nconventional warfare again.

It provides a\\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\\n  \"program\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\\n  instrument.\\n\\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\\n  the development of custom code.)\\n\\nUltimage Concept VI\\n-------------------\\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\\n\\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\\n  characterization.\\n\\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\\n  be imported.\\n\\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects\\' detection, measurement, and\\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The\\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\\n  modules.\\n\\n  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can\\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight\\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are\\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\\n  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\\n  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as\\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\\n  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\\n\\n  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\\n  hole filling.\\n\\n  The program\\'s quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\\n\\n  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494\\n  707-579-1733\\n\\nIPLab Spectrum\\n--------------\\n  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\\n  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user\\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far\\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool\\n  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a\\n  movie command for cycling through windows.\\n\\n\\nMacintosh-based tools\\n=====================\\n\\nNCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more\\n---------------------------------\\n  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the\\n  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results\\n  from numerical modelling calculations.

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with\\n  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS\\n  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.\\n  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted\\n  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For\\n  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from\\n  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,\\n  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include\\n  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation\\n  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to\\n  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,\\n  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.\\n\\n  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard\\n  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,\\n  availlable from Storm Technologies.

Several steps are often required to\\n  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The\\n  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can\\n  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.

Image Analyst lets users configure\\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\\n  radiographs.\\n\\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\\n  a disk-stored image.\\n\\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\\n\\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also\\n  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.\\n\\n  Automatix, Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica, MA 01821 508-667-7900\\n\\nIPLab\\n-----\\n  Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna, VA  22180 703-281-3277\\n  FAX 703-281-2509\\n\\n  \"Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or\\n  pseudocolor/grayscale image display and manipulation.\"\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II distributed by John Wiley has\\n  integrated image analysis.\\n\\nIMAGE\\n-----\\n  from Stanford : Try anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n  It has pd source for image v2, and ready to run code for a mac under\\n  image v3.\\n\\n\\n\\nWindows/DOS PC-based tools\\n==========================\\n\\nCCD\\n---\\n  Richard Berry\\'s CCD imaging book for Willamon-Bell contains (optional?)\\n  disks with image manipulating software.

All functions can be easily accessed via the\\n  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image\\n  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that\\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\\n  modules.\\n\\n  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\\n  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and\\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\\n  ratioing.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer\\'s environments. Using\\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\\n  applications programs.\\n\\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\\n  interactively driven through this control.\\n\\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\\n\\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\\n  required.

It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\\n\\n  Feature description\\n\\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\\n\\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\\n\\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\\n  ``filters\\'\\'.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\\n\\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]\\n\\n  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives\\n  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional\\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS\\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of\\n  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other \\n  palettes can be generated.\\n\\n\\nSupported functions include such niceties as the following:\\n\\no  image & image: + - / * interpolation\\no  image & constant: + - / *\\no  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,\\n   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.\\no  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or\\n   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.\\no  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,\\n   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp\\n   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.

If you move or copy\\n      files, you will enter \\'write\\' menu. the \\'write\\' menu is much like\\n      \\'read\\' menu, but only allow you to change directory.\\n+       The header line in \\'read\\' menu includes \"(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)\".\\n+         d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.\\n      pressing SPACE in \\'read\\' menu will let you select which format to use\\n        for reading current file.\\n      pressing RETURN in \\'read\\' menu will let you reading current file. This\\n        program will automatically determine which format this file is.\\n        The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check\\n        standard extension. Still fail, report error.\\n      pressing s or S in \\'read\\' menu will do \\'Slide Show\\'.\\n        If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key\\n          (except ESCAPE).\\n        If any error occurs, program will make a beep.\\n        ESCAPE to terminate.\\n      pressing Ins in \\'read\\' menu will change display type.\\n      pressing ALT-X in \\'read\\' menu will quit program without prompting.\\n\\n   2. Once image file is successfully read, you will enter \\'screen\\' menu.\\n      Within this menu F5 is turn on. You can do special effect on image.\\n      pressing RETURN: show image.\\n        in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text\\n        mode.\\n      pressing TAB: change processing target.

Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program\\n        will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another\\n        directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after\\n        pressing SPACE, you will enter \\'write2\\' menu. You can change\\n        directory to what you want. Then,\\n\\n        pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you \\'original\\' filename.\\n        pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you \\'selected\\' filename\\n                      (filename under bar).\\n\\n\\n  3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.\\n\\n  4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don\\'t have enough memory,\\n     the performance is poor.\\n\\n  5. If you want to save 8 bits image :\\n       try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...\\n\\n     If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):\\n       try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster\\n       (No one is better for true 24bits image)\\n\\n  6.

If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked\\nquestions that you would like included in this posting, send email to\\nleech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).\\n\\n    If you don\\'t want to see the FAQ, add \\'Frequently Asked Questions\\' to\\nyour KILL file for this group (if you\\'re not reading this with a newsreader\\nthat can kill articles by subject, you\\'re out of luck).\\n\\n    The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down\\nby rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in\\nthe Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.\\n\\n    Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The\\npoint of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old\\nanswers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing\\nthan rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided\\nbecause they give more complete information than any short generalization.\\n\\n    Questions fall into three basic types:\\n\\n    1) Where do I find some information about space?\\n\\n    Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask\\n    for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There\\n    are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended\\n    discussion.\\n\\n    2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?\\n\\n    Hope you aren\\'t surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been\\n    thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for\\n    evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.\\n\\n    3) Miscellanous queries.\\n\\n    These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of\\n    FAQ postings.\\n\\n\\n    SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE\\n\\n    Read news.announce.newusers if you\\'re on Usenet.\\n    Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]\\n    Edit \"Subject:\" lines, especially if you\\'re taking a tangent.\\n    Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth\\n\\t100 posts).\\n    Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST\\n\\tnot SPACE.\\n    Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all\\n\\treferences.)\\n    Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you\\'re\\n\\tresponding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize!\\n    Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail\\n\\tor article), state your institution, etc. Don\\'t assume the\\n\\t\\'reply\\' function of mailers will work.\\n    Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don\\'t post what everyone\\n\\twill get on TV anyway.\\n    Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping:\\n\\tkeep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals\\n\\t(use carriage returns).\\n\\n\\n    INDEX TO LINKED POSTINGS\\n\\n    I\\'ve attempted to break the postings up into related areas. There isn\\'t\\n    a keyword index yet; the following lists the major subject areas in each\\n    posting. Only those containing astronomy-related material are posted to\\n    sci.astro (indicated by \\'*\\' following the posting number).\\n\\n    #\\tContents\\n\\n    1*\\tIntroduction\\n\\t    Suggestions for better netiquette\\n\\t    Index to linked postings\\n\\t    Notes on addresses, phone numbers, etc.\\n\\t    Contributors\\n\\n    2*\\tNetwork resources\\n\\t    Overview\\n\\t    Mailing lists\\n\\t    Periodically updated information\\n\\t    Warning about non-public networks\\n\\n    3*\\tOnline (and some offline) sources of images, data, etc.\\n\\t    Introduction\\n\\t    Viewing Images\\n\\t    Online Archives\\n\\t\\tNASA Ames\\n\\t\\tNASA Astrophysics Data System\\n\\t\\tNASA Jet Propulsion Lab (Mission Information and Images)\\n\\t\\tNASA Langley (Technical Reports)\\n\\t\\tNASA Spacelink\\n\\t\\tNational Space Science Data Center\\n\\t\\tSpace Telescope Science Institute Electronic Info.

What, you may ask, does gas guns\\nhave to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically\\nlocated across the road from the Free Electron Laser building,\\nand the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls)\\nfrom which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the\\noffice he works for is an administrative convenience.\\n\\nI visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun.\\nAt the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work,\\nbut I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),\\n\\nThe gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber\\nabout 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe).\\nThe chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several\\nhundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston\\nis hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens\\nof atmospheres.\\n\\nThe piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until\\na stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.\\nThe barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch\\nbore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they\\nintersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel\\ncould be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to\\nmove the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used\\nin testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter\\nand about 50 cm long.\\n\\nAll of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen\\ngas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the\\nbarrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a\\nsheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The\\nplastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped\\nin the barrel ahead of the projectile.  \\n\\nThe gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic\\nwater jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic\\nprojectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,\\nthe projectile vaporizes.\\n\\nThe testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is\\nabout 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km\\nif fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun\\nto Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can\\nfire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB\\nto follow the projectiles.\\n\\nThe design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4\\nkm/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s,\\nand the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test\\nthey blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it\\nhad to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but\\nI haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).\\n\\nThere are people waiting to test scramjet components in this\\ngun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=\\n4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.\\n\\nThis gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically\\na proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-\\nsized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of\\n100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg\\nuseful payload to orbit.\\n\\nDani Eder\\n\\n-- \\nDani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/\\nRt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.\\n\",\n",

Digital immortality.\\n\\nThe basic idea behind \"digital immortality\" is that computer networks   \\nare here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them\\nwill be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the\\nartifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they\\'ll be put in different\\nformats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they\\'ll be\\nthere...and someone will dig them up.  \\n \\nIf that doesn\\'t interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique\\nand exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes\\nand exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang\\nas wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is \\nbreathed into your work...and by merit of it\\'s stimulus, it will \\ntravel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.\\n \\nSpectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and \\nlet the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own\\ncopies of the images to look at when you\\'ve got the gumption...\\nthat\\'s what they\\'re here for.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWHERE?             \\n\\nOTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.  \\n \\n \\t141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tsunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite \\n\\t(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)\\n\\nMerely \"anonymous FTP\" to either site on Internet and change to the\\nappropriate directory.  Don\\'t forget to get busy and use the \"bin\"\\ncommand to make sure you\\'re in binary.\\n\\nOTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North\\nAmerica....the following systems have a substancial supply of\\nOTIStuff...\\n\\tUnderground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines\\n\\tCyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n \\nHOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?\\n              \\nWhat happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely   \\nphoto, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put\\nit in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me\\n(email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received,\\nit will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works\\nare also welcome.\\n\\nOTIS\\' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.  \\nGIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to \\nsee.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at \\nmost large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit\\ntougher to find.  If you can\\'t find one, but do have a GIF viewer,  \\nyou can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change    \\nJPG files to a standard GIF format. \\n\\nOTIS also accepts animation files.      \\n\\nWhen you submit image files, please send me email at the same time\\nstating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be\\nused (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people\\nto view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we\\'ll\\nbe having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You \\ncan also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of \\nemailing).\\n\\nIf you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send\\ncopies to:\\n\\nThe OTIS Project\\nc/o Ed Stastny\\nPO BX 241113\\nOmaha, NE 68124-1113\\n\\nI will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  \\nscan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.  \\nAlso include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line \\ndescription of the image that we can include in the infofile in the\\ndirectory where it\\'s finally put.  If you have preferences as to what\\nthe images are to be named, include those as well.  \\n \\nConversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please\\ncontact me and we\\'ll arrange things.\\n\\nIf you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5\"\\ndisk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.\\nThis is good for people who don\\'t have direct access to encoders or FTP,\\nbut do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM\\ncompatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or\\nJPG.  If you can\\'t...we can convert from most formats...we\\'d just rather\\nnot have to.\\n\\nAt senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they\\ncan stand.  Even if you don\\'t have stuff to contribute, you can send\\na blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to \\nget a slab-o-OTIS.\\n\\nAs of 04/21/93, we\\'re at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  \\nEmail me for current archive size and directory.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISTRIBUTION?\\n\\nThe images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   \\non the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is\\nnot altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to\\nanother).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local \\nbulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the\\nappropriate text files along with the images.  \\n \\nIt would also be nice if you\\'d send me a note when you did post images\\nfrom OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so\\nparticipants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.\\n\\nIt\\'s the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as\\npossible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite\\nBBS system....or even just post this \"info-file\" there.  It would be\\nkeen of you.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUSE?\\n\\nIf you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,\\nyou\\'ll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the \\nstipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or\\nfull address credit).  You will either find this in the \".rm\" file for    \\nthe image or series of images...or in the \"Artists\" directory under the \\nArtists name.  If permission isn\\'t explicitly given, then you\\'ll have \\nto contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email\\nme (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I\\'ll get in contact with the artist for \\nyou, or give you their contact information.\\n \\nWhen you DO use permitted work, it\\'s always courteous to let the artist\\nknow about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such\\ncompensation for their files.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNAMING IMAGES?\\n\\nPlease keep the names of your files in \"dos\" format.  That means, keep\\nthe filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way\\nI usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or\\nfour digit \"code\" for the series of images, plus the series number.\\nThus, Leonardo DeVinci\\'s fifth mechanical drawing would be something\\nlike:\\n \\n\\tldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC\\n\\nKeeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will\\nremain intact on all systems.  \\n\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \\n\\nCREATING IMAGE FILES?\\n\\nWhen creating image files, be sure to at least include your name\\nsomewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in\\ncase they\\'d like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title,\\naddress or other information you\\'d like people to know.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHMMM?!\\n\\nThat\\'s about it for now.  More \"guidelines\" will be added as needed.\\nYour input is expected.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS  \\n \\t     (a sumerian deity) or it\\'s followers, be they pope, priest,\\n\\t     or ezine administrator.  We do take sacrifices and donations\\n\\t     however.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original \\n \\t     image files.  The files will go to the public at large.  \\n\\t     It\\'s possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone\\n\\t     could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.  \\n    \\t     Unless you\\'ve given permission for that, it\\'s illegal.  OTIS\\n\\t     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights\\n\\t     revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to \\n\\t     give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed \\n\\t     electronically.  If you don\\'t want your images distributed     \\n\\t     all-over, don\\'t upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is\\n\\t     NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or\\n\\t     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not \\n\\t     limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,        \\n\\t     screen-printed clothing, etc).  You must give specific\\n\\t     permission for this sort of usage.  \\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRemember, the operative term is \"stimulate\".

Sphinx also reads and writes the common TIFF and GIF formats\\nas well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk space.\\n\\n\\t\\t    Image Analysis & Processing\\n\\n\\tFor image and pixel analysis, the Sphinx package includes an\\nassortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and \\nmathematical filtering operations, such as Fourier transforms, convolution \\nproduct or principal component analyses.\\nAn interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allows\\nthe user to manipulate and combine individual data channels interactively.\\nStandard FORTRAN notation is used for formula entry and for trig\\nonometric and transcendental functions.\\n\\n\\t\\t    Satellite Spectra & Orbit Analysis\\n\\n\\tSphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivity\\nfor various meteorological satellites (e.g., GOES, METEOSAT, NOAA, Spot etc.).\\nThe simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric and\\nsurface conditions and instrument spectral bands.\\nA geometry model computes the solar zenith angles, warping, orbit simulation,\\nand 3-D image projection.\\n\\n\\t\\t    Easy External Program Interfacing\\n\\n\\tSphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externally\\ndeveloped software algorithms for processing and converting satellite\\nobservations.  Sphinx exports and imports image files and image parameters\\nto external programs using special interface functions.\\n\\n\\t\\t    Quick Quality Presentation\\n\\n\\tSphinx rapidly displays, manipulates, and enhances high-resolution\\nmultispectral images and color tables.  Using six 8-bit 1024x1024 image\\nplanes and one graphics plane, the package conveniently combines color images,\\ngraphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and reports.\\nSphinx\\'s 2-D and 3-D graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifying\\nand integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images, such as \\nhistograms and radial graphs.  The package supplies color and gray scale\\noutput for standard inkjet and laser printers.\\n\\tOther Capabilities Sphinx also performs image animation, external \\ngraphics importing, mosaic fitting... what else?\\n\\n\\t\\t    Software Support & Development\\n\\n\\t Sphinx was developed at the Laboratoire d\\'Optique Atmospherique (LOA)\\n of the Universite de Lille, France.\\nThe package has received critical feedback and support from scientists at\\nthe French national laboratory, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),\\nand the French space agency, Centre National d\\'Etudes Spatiales (CNES).\\nAt LOA, Sphinx undergoes continued refinement and development to meet changing\\nresearch needs and advances in computer technology.  The package, which features\\non-line help, is supported by an Internet address\\n\\n sphinx@loasil.citilille.fr through which questions can be answered and\\n version updates provided without delay.\\n\\n\\t\\t    Performance Tested\\n\\n \\tCNES has selected Sphinx to analyze and process the satellite data \\ncollected during the upcoming ADEOS/POLDER satellite mission.  Today,\\nthe Sphinx package is in use at the NASA - Goddard Space Flight Center\\nand is widely used in many French laboratories, including\\nthe Centre de Recherche en Physique de l\\'Environnement, Ecole Normale Superieure ,\\nLaboratoire d\\' Etudes et de Recherches en Teledetection Spatiale,  Laboratoire \\nde Meteorologie Dynamique.\\n\\n\\n   A TEST VERSION OF SPHINX IS AVAILABLE AT loasil.citilille.fr\\n   (134.206.50.4) anonymous (bin : cd SPHINX : get ALL_SPHINX.tar.Z)\\n\\n   IN THE TEST VERSION THE OUTPUT FILES ARE DISABLE.

However, the rumors\\n>I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter\\n>seems more likely.\\n\\nYo Ken, let\\'s keep on-top of things! Both the \"External Tank\" and\\n\"Wingless Orbiter\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign\\noptions list. Today\\'s (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports\\nthat O\\'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have\\nbeen dropped, such as using the \"giant external fuel tanks used\\nin launching space shuttles,\" and building a \"station around\\nan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\"\\n\\nCurrently, there are three options being considered, as presented\\nto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in\\ntoday\\'s Times).\\n\\nOption \"A\" - Low Cost Modular Approach\\nThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,\\nthere are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting\\nthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and\\nReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\\nteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\\noption are:\\n  -  Uses \"Bus-1\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that\\'s\\n     qualified for STS and ELV\\'s. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C\\n     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this\\n     for the Air Force.\\n  -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\\n     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\\n     source for 30 day missions.\\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\\n     Partners\\' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\\n     add another 20 kW of power\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\\n     Vehicle).\\n\\nOption \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived\\nThe Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\\nhave all come to know and love :)\\n\\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the \\nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\\nfor both options \"A\" and \"B\".\\n\\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\\n     it visits.\\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\\n     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\\n  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\\n     assembly in 24 flights.\\n\\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \\nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\\nchanges.\\n\\nOption C - Single Core Launch Station.\\nThis is the JSC lead option. Basically, you take a 23 ft diameter\\ncylinder that\\'s 92 ft long, slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines on\\nthe backside, put a nose cone on the top, attached it to a \\nregular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket\\nmotors, and launch the can. Some key features are:\\n  - Complete end-to-end ground integration and checkout\\n  - 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels\\n  - body mounted radiators (which adds protection against\\n    micrometeroid & orbital debris)\\n  - 2 centerline docking ports (one on each end)\\n  - 7 berthing ports\\n  - a single pressurized volume, approximately 26,000 cubic feet\\n    (twice the volume of skylab).\\n  - 7 floors, center passageway between floors\\n  - 10 kW of housekeeping power\\n  - graceful degradation with failures (8 power channels, 4 thermal\\n    loops, dual environmental control & life support system)\\n  - increased crew time for utilization\\n  - 1 micro-g thru out the core module\\n',\n",

However, the manual that came with it only describes how to\\nformat the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial\\nproblems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a\\nparallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4\\nbit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the\\n256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video\\nsignal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they\\ndid say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but\\nthey didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they\\nwould call Japan, etc.\\n\\nFrankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images\\nfrom the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.

How do I become an astronaut?\\n\\n    A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it\\'s probably\\n    impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying\\n    passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have\\n    so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you\\'re better off hoping to\\n    win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet\\n    experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you\\n    want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle \"mission\\n    specialist\".\\n\\n    If you aren\\'t a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,\\n    the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly\\n    exceeds the supply.  NASA\\'s problem is not finding qualified people,\\n    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.\\tIt is not enough\\n    to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,\\n    many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.\\n\\n    Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands\\n    dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer\\n    programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-\\n    seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in\\n    another seems to be a frequent winner.\\n\\n    Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.\\t(DO NOT get a\\n    radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows\\n    what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term\\n    effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other\\n    significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,\\n    you should be okay; if you can\\'t, your chances are poor.\\n\\n    Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in\\n    appearance and actions; you\\'ve got a tough selling job ahead, trying\\n    to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you\\n    are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you\\n    will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is\\n    a significant part of the job, and NASA\\'s image is very prim and\\n    proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.\\n    Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,\\n    and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.\\n    Keep your nose clean.\\n\\n    Get a pilot\\'s license and make flying your number one hobby;\\n    experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.\\n\\n    Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,\\n    43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were\\n    a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).\\n    If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job\\n    at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant \"you\\n    do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first\".\\n\\n    Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance\\n    to demonstrate motivation.\\n\\n    Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn\\'t make it the first time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    NASA\\n    National Aeronautics and Space Administration\\n    Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center\\n    Houston, Texas\\n\\n    Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates\\n    ==================================================================\\n\\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\\n    ---------------------------\\n\\n    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for\\n    Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates\\n    to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a\\n    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.\\n\\n    Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be\\n    considered.\\n\\n    All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in\\n    Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation\\n    program.\\n\\n    Space Shuttle Program Description\\n    ---------------------------------\\n\\n    The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated\\n    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming\\n    routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in\\n    the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then\\n    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and\\n    flight crew.\\n\\n    The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment\\n    and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation\\n    of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials\\n    processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will\\n    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space\\n    station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher\\n    orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space\\n    Shuttle\\'s capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include\\n    government agencies and private industries.\\n\\n    The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,\\n    and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are\\n    assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA\\n    astronauts.\\n\\n    Pilot Astronaut\\n\\n    Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.\\n    During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,\\n    crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the\\n    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the\\n    pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing\\n    the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other\\n    payload operations.\\n\\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut\\n\\n    Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,\\n    have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations\\n    in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and\\n    experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to\\n    have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed\\n    knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and\\n    objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the\\n    experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission\\n    specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling\\n    using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific\\n    experimental operations.\\n\\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\\n    ===========================\\n\\n    Basic Qualification Requirements\\n    --------------------------------\\n\\n    Applicants MUST meet the following minimum requirements prior to\\n    submitting an application.\\n\\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidate:\\n\\n    1.

Degree must be\\n    followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,\\n    professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable. Quality of\\n    academic preparation is important.\\n\\n    2. At least 1000 hours pilot-in-command time in jet aircraft. Flight\\n    test experience highly desirable.\\n\\n    3. Ability to pass a NASA Class I space physical which is similar to a\\n    military or civilian Class I flight physical and includes the following\\n    specific standards:\\n\\n\\t Distant visual acuity:\\n\\t      20/50 or better uncorrected\\n\\t      correctable to 20/20, each eye.\\n\\n\\t Blood pressure:\\n\\t      140/90 measured in sitting position.\\n\\n    4. Height between 64 and 76 inches.\\n\\n    Citizenship Requirements\\n\\n    Applications for the Astronaut Candidate Program must be citizens of\\n    the United States.\\n\\n    Note on Academic Requirements\\n\\n    Applicants for the Astronaut Candidate Program must meet the basic\\n    education requirements for NASA engineering and scientific positions --\\n    specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum\\n    in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor\\'s\\n    degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering,\\n    biological science, physical science, or mathematics.\\n\\n      The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the\\n    sciences, are not considered qualifying:\\n      - Degrees in technology (Engineering Technology, Aviation Technology,\\n\\tMedical Technology, etc.)\\n      - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, Physiological\\n\\tPsychology, or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying).\\n      - Degrees in Nursing.\\n      - Degrees in social sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.)\\n      - Degrees in Aviation, Aviation Management or similar fields.\\n\\n    Application Procedures\\n    ----------------------\\n\\n    Civilian\\n\\n    The application package may be obtained by writing to:\\n\\n\\tNASA Johnson Space Center\\n\\tAstronaut Selection Office\\n\\tATTN: AHX\\n\\tHouston, TX 77058\\n\\n    Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA\\n    decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be\\n    given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is\\n    made. Applications received after that date will be retained and\\n    considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually\\n    of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate\\n    continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants\\n    who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from\\n    consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the\\n    preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be\\n    requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as\\n    supervisors and references may be contacted.\\n\\n    Active Duty Military\\n\\n    Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their\\n    respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application\\n    procedures will be disseminated by each service.\\n\\n    Selection\\n    ---------\\n\\n    Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required\\n    for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.\\n    Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered\\n    will be notified of the outcome of the process.\\n\\n    Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the\\n    selection of additional candidates during a one year period following\\n    their establishment.\\n\\n    General Program Requirements\\n\\n    Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be\\n    assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,\\n    Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and\\n    evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or\\n    scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to\\n    ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut\\n    training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills\\n    required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot\\n    astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during\\n    their candidate period.\\n\\n    Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does\\n    not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut\\n    will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and\\n    evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the\\n    training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become\\n    permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for\\n    a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not\\n    selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA\\n    depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that\\n    time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a\\n    specified tour of duty.\\n\\n    NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified\\n    minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.\\n    Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.\\n\\n    Pay and Benefits\\n    ----------------\\n\\n    Civilians\\n\\n    Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal\\n    Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,\\n    and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements\\n    and experience.\\n\\n    Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and\\n    participation in group health and life insurance plans.\\n\\n    Military\\n\\n    Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center\\n    but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and\\n    other similar military matters.\\n\\n\\nNEXT: FAQ #15/15 - Orbital and Planetary Launch Services\\n',\n",

Mountain View, CA\\nLines: 90\\n\\nIn <1qjrec$qem@network.ucsd.edu> spl@ivem.ucsd.edu (Steve Lamont) writes:\\n| What I *am* annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that\\n| we *would* be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the\\n| Crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck.\\n\\nIt should have been made fairly clear that the *most* Crimson would\\never get was a 150 (75 old style) MHz CPU upgrade.  Certainly this\\nwas mentioned on comp.sys.sgi on more than one occasion as being\\nlikely.  If our sales folks were saying otherwise, they were either\\nconfused, or less than honest/ethical, or somebody further up the\\nchain inside SGI was misleading them.\\n\\n| I\\'m also annoyed about being sold *several* Personal IRISes at a\\n| previous site on the understanding *that* architecture would be around\\n| for a while, rather than being flushed.\\n\\nThere were 4 versions (20, 25, 30, 35), although admittedly the 30 came\\nout at the same time as the 35, over a period of 2 1/2 years.  The\\nchassis simply couldn\\'t be pushed any further.  I\\'d say 4 years was\\na pretty good lifespan, myself, for a system design in this day and\\nage.  Getting the 35 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the\\nhardware and product design groups; we would have been out of our\\nminds to push it further, and I *know* that was made clear, almost\\nfrom the day the 35 started shipping.  We had one last kicker in\\nthe form of the Elan graphics, which made 3 graphics versions over\\nits lifespan, which I also think is pretty good.\\n\\n| Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to\\n| keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that I found myself\\n| pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books\\n| just before the end of the quarter), but I\\'m just a little tired of\\n| getting boned in the process.\\n\\nPlease, by all means send a complaint letter through SGI support\\nor sales on your concerns.  There should be no reason for sales folks\\nto misrepresent future upgrades to customers (sure, sometimes there\\nwill be confusion for a while, over whether an upgrade will be available,\\nbut that shouldn\\'t last too long, and doesn\\'t seem to be what you\\nare referring to).\\n\\nYes, the sales folks *do* get bonus\\'s at the end of some (all?) quarters,\\nbut that is pretty common industry wide, and sometimes that can result\\nin good deals for customers (sometimes it probably pushes folks into\\nsystems that aren\\'t what they need, I\\'m sure, but nobody is *forcing*\\nyou to buy at end of quarter, after all...)\\n\\n| Maybe it\\'s because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies, so we\\n| aren\\'t entitled to a \"peek under the covers\" as the Big Kids (NASA,\\n| for instance) are.  This lab, and I suspect that a lot of other labs\\n\\nThey don\\'t get all that long a lead time either; although certainly\\nthey get presentations on possible new products, and their opinions\\nmay well influence the end product, but that also is life in the\\nindustry.  We can\\'t design systems that meet just their needs, or we\\nwon\\'t sell too many systems, after all (which is not to say that we\\ndon\\'t have some niche products, like Reality Engine).\\n\\n| and organizations, doesn\\'t have a load of money to spend on computers\\n| every year, so we can\\'t be out buying new systems on a regular basis.\\n| The boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the\\n| entire grant period of five years and, in some case, beyond.  That\\n| means that I need to buy the best piece of equipment that I can when I\\n| have the money, not some product that was built, to paraphrase one\\n| previous poster\\'s words, \\'to fill a niche\\' to compete with some other\\n| vendor.  I\\'m going to be looking at this box for the next five years.\\n| And every time I look at it, I\\'m going to think about SGI and how I\\n| could have better spent my money (actually *your* money, since we\\'re\\n| supported almost entirely by Federal tax dollars).\\n\\nBut surely you don\\'t expect a system you buy now for a five year\\nperiod to be constantly upgradable over that entire five year\\nperiod?  That\\'s a rather unreasonable expectation, in my experience\\n(with workstations/microcomputers).  Supported, and parts available,\\nyes, but certainly not upgradable to the latest and greatest!\\n\\n| Now you\\'ll have to pardon me while I go off and hiss and fume in a\\n| corner somewhere and think dark, libelous thoughts.\\n\\nI missed your first posting, but as I say, by all means share your\\nfrustation with somebody at a level inside SGI where it might\\nhave an effect (not immediate, I\\'m sure, but complaints aren\\'t\\ngoing to be ignored, and *may* affect future plans, if we \\nhear similar things from more than one person/site).\\n\\nAll of the above is, as usual, my personal opinion, not SGI\\'s.\\n--\\nLet no one tell me that silence gives consent,  |   Dave Olson\\nbecause whoever is silent dissents.             |   Silicon Graphics, Inc.\\n    Maria Isabel Barreno                        |   olson@sgi.com\\nPS: I start my sabbatical 29 May, ask those questions now ;)\\n',\n",

D1).  I thought I\\'d post it to\\nstir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by\\nsaying that I largely agree that the \"Space Age\" in the romantic sense\\nof several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station\\nmiss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, \"What\\'s New\" -\\nthe weekly physics update we get here on the net - it\\'s clear that the\\nromance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of\\nmatter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with\\nits spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things\\npeople are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I\\nthink, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of\\nnostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our \"mind\\nchildren\" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but\\nI think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about\\nwhat we can do *now*.   \\n\\nAnyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...\\n\\n\\nSPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW\\n\\nMicheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)\\n\\nAt 35, America\\'s Space Age won\\'t have to suffer through the angst of a\\nmidlife crisis.\\n\\nThe reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no\\nlonger define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion\\n-dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic\\nrewards.  \\n\\nSpace exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America\\'s science\\nand technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a\\nmeaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our\\ntechnology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion\\npolicy.  \\n\\nTo be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies\\nfor telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes\\nwould be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of\\nscientific and industrial innovation is now dead.\\n\\n.....\\n\\nBefore the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to\\nwrite an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively\\nsupported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion\\nto build space station Freedom alone.\\n\\nEven as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains,\\nOffice of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken\\npublic champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much\\nof the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope\\nto the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively\\nimplemented did not seem to matter much.\\n\\nPolitical inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent\\nvision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar\\nspace budgets.\\n\\nIndeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo\\nera is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration\\nwith programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.  \\n\\n......\\n\\nWhile the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel\\nGoldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space\\nAdministration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being\\npositioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America\\'s\\ntechnological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been\\nslashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions\\nits competitiveness agenda.\\n\\n......\\n\\n\"I wish this had happened 10 years ago instead of starting to happen\\nnow,\" says Bruce Murray, a Caltech professor who ran NASA\\'s Jet\\nPropulsion Lab in Pasadena.  \"We\\'ve put off a lot of things we shouldn\\'t\\nhave....

Matthew\\n    Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on\\n    Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material\\n    posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).\\n\\nUS PLANETARY MISSIONS\\n\\n\\n    MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\\n\\n    MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed\\n    minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground\\n    stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the\\n    onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in\\n    the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the\\n    Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed\\n    to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a\\n    transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted\\n    from the expression \"R-dot-bar sub n\" (nth smoothed value of derivative\\n    of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations\\n    of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.\\n\\n    MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December\\n    of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a\\n    very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world\\n    with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide\\n    (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).\\n\\n    MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective\\n    shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary\\n    space. Unable to collect the Sun\\'s energy for power from its solar\\n    panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in\\n    solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.\\n\\n    MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and\\n    took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it\\n    flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere\\n    much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from\\n    this preliminary scan that Mars was a \"dead\" world in both the\\n    geological and biological sense.\\n\\n    MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that\\n    planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information\\n    that Venus\\' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times\\n    that of Earth\\'s, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface\\n    of an ocean.\\n\\n    MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work\\n    done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away\\n    the concept of Mars as a \"dead\" planet, first made from the basic\\n    measurements of MARINER 4.\\n\\n    MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket\\n    launcher autopilot failed.\\n\\n    MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to\\n    orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no\\n    other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian\\n    surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once\\n    flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup\\n    images of Mars\\' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.\\n\\n    MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe\\n    did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in\\n    ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,\\n    plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four\\n    Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974\\n    to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed\\n    Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than\\n    thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which\\n    makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.\\n\\n\\n    PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\\n\\n    PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph\\n    the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide\\n    new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new\\n    data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft\\n    had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on\\n    October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.\\n\\n    PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first\\n    U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally\\n    designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead\\n    studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to\\n    36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6\\n    through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,\\n    and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would\\n    have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.\\n\\n    PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER\\n    11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to\\n    study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through\\n    1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever\\n    to do so.\\n\\n    PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER\\n    12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made\\n    the first radar studies of the planet\\'s surface via probe. PIONEER Venus\\n    2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere\\n    in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the\\n    atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the\\n    surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day\\n    probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before\\n    its batteries failed.\\n\\n\\n    RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)\\n\\n    RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They\\n    were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems\\n    left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.\\n\\n    RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an\\n    instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the\\n    launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.\\n    RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the\\n    camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.\\n\\n    RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but\\n    suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,\\n    the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.\\n\\n    RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost\\n    all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon\\n    and drifted off into solar orbit.\\n\\n    RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send\\n    back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact\\n    with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras\\n    did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first\\n    U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.\\n\\n\\n    LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)\\n\\n    LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image\\n    various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO\\n    missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our\\n    understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.\\n    All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were\\n    essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.\\n    probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar\\n    surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.\\n\\n\\n    SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)\\n\\n    The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar\\n    module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the\\n    soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered\\n    in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing\\n    vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was\\n    strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.\\n\\n    Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the\\n    first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images\\n    and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from\\n    SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,\\n    the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored\\n    the Tycho crater region in 1968.\\n\\n\\n    VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)\\n\\n    VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on\\n    a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June\\n    19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse\\n    Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for\\n    Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes\\n    found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of\\n    its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars\\' sky was\\n    pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is\\n    pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the\\n    thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and\\n    boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.\\n\\n    The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran\\n    out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a\\n    weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep\\n    functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command\\n    had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until\\n    further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the\\n    engineers\\' efforts through May of 1983.\\n\\n    An interesting side note: VIKING 1\\'s lander has been designated the\\n    Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the\\n    lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,\\n    D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until\\n    it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.\\n\\n    VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit\\n    on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in\\n    Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its\\n    sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording\\n    one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in\\n    1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut\\n    down on April 12, 1980.\\n\\n    The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.\\n\\n\\n    VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)\\n\\n    VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March\\n    5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched\\n    August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,\\n    1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and\\n    by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare\\n    once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to\\n    outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,\\n    but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.\\n\\n    Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their\\n    satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered\\n    that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and\\n    aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major\\n    surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous\\n    volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.\\n\\n    When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets\\n    and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep\\n    the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive\\n    jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle\\n    is known). Titan\\'s atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas\\' appearance was\\n    startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.\\n    The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,\\n    kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.\\n\\n    VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,\\n    continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly\\n    monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was\\n    found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational\\n    axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on\\n    Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10\\n    satellites and one more ring were discovered.\\n\\n    In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,\\n    including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright\\n    patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were\\n    discovered. Neptune\\'s magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a\\n    canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What\\'s liquid at 38K?)\\n\\n    The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their\\n    on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets\\n    beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the\\n    location of the heliopause.\\n\\n\\nSOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS\\n\\n    Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and\\n    Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:\\n\\n\\n    SOVIET LUNAR PROBES\\n\\n    LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first\\n\\t     craft in solar orbit.\\n    LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.\\n    LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.\\n    ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was\\n\\t     also a test for future Mars missions.\\n    LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images\\n\\t     from surface.\\n    LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.\\n    LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.\\n    ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft.

LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in\\n\\t      1972.\\n    LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon\\'s\\n\\t      surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished\\n\\t      with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.\\n    LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in\\n\\t      1976.\\n\\n\\n    SOVIET VENUS PROBES\\n\\n    VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions\\n\\t       lost enroute in 1961.\\n    VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with\\n\\t       VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in\\n\\t       February of 1966. No images were returned.\\n    VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.\\n\\t       Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe\\n\\t       became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.\\n    VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending\\n\\t       through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before\\n\\t       reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles\\n\\t       similar in 1969.\\n    VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet\\n\\t       in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in\\n\\t       1972.\\n    VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the\\n\\t       first probe to orbit Venus.

Flyby buses went on\\n\\t     to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in\\n\\t     March of 1986.\\n\\n\\n    SOVIET MARS PROBES\\n\\n    MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased\\n\\t     enroute the following year.\\n    ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian\\n\\t     surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.\\n    MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian\\n\\t     surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red\\n\\t     Planet in 1971.\\n    MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander\\n\\t     signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.\\n    MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to\\n\\t     fire, probe went on into solar orbit.\\n    MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in\\n\\t     1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.\\n\\t     probe MARINER 9.\\n    MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.\\n    MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit\\n\\t     with its flyby bus.\\n    PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars\\' largest\\n\\t       moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to\\n\\t       human/computer error.\\n    PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did\\n\\t       enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week\\n\\t       before scheduled Phobos landing.\\n\\n    While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even\\n    interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have\\n    yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,\\n    Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a\\n    Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been\\n    planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now\\n    the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their\\n    space program remains to be seen.\\n\\n\\nJAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS\\n\\n    SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on\\n    January 8 1985, and approached Halley\\'s Comet within about 7 million km\\n    on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to\\n    measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of\\n    which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on\\n    January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth\\'s. The closest\\n    approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The\\n    geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for\\n    a Japanese spacecraft.\\n\\n    During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail\\n    passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby\\n    will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth\\'s radius)), and the third\\n    October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).\\n\\n\\n    HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,\\n    1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten\\n    once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first\\n    lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget\\n    satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to\\n    orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.\\n\\n    The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An\\n    apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists\\n    to lose track of it. Hagoromo\\'s rocket motor fired on schedule on March\\n    19, but the spacecraft\\'s tracking transmitter failed immediately. The\\n    rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt\\n    camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.\\n\\n    Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and\\n    performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth\\'s atmosphere. Hiten\\n    made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,\\n    1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon\\'s surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and\\n    fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into\\n    lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the\\n    approach:\\n\\n\\tApoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km\\n\\tPeriapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km\\n\\tInclination\\t: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)\\n\\tPeriod\\t\\t: 4.7 days\\n\\n\\nPLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES\\n\\n    I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three\\n    groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,\\n    and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means\\n    complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your\\n    research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can\\n    add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.\\n\\n    Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it\\n    would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in\\n    order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in\\n    this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date\\n    general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra\\n    background.

Aert Jansz, de eerste\\nwaarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde\\nin de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de\\nvoorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek.

Er\\nstaat echter meer op stapel.\\n\\nStudenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een\\nsterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het\\nsymposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het\\nhuidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten\\n\\'compacte objecten\\', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren.\\nBij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de\\ndeelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van\\nde stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de\\neerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een\\nbeknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren,\\nwaarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een\\nhalf uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten\\nzullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot\\nhet stellen van vragen.

De op te vangen signalen zijn\\nnamelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10\\nmiljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30\\nWatt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal\\ner niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse\\ntechnologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.\\n\\nDeelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en\\nf 16,- (inclusief lunch).

But these were\\nmiracles of our parent\\'s doing.  For a decade and more the pundits\\nhave told us - \"you\\'ve lost it!\"  The \"me\" generation is only\\nliving on the accomplishments of the past.\\n\\n     You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We\\nlisten in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living\\nhistory they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell\\nof it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as\\nGeneral Bernie Schriever told of his team\\'s work - and yes struggle\\n- to build this nation\\'s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.\\n\\n     What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand\\ndollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only\\nof that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen.\\nSchriever\\'s ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the\\nbest new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and\\nPoseidon ballistic missiles.\\n\\n     Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing. \\nThis event is proof.  To our technological parents: We\\'ve listened\\nto your stories.  We\\'ve caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. \\nAnd we\\'ve learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let\\nme honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus\\nbehind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest\\nengineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your\\ninsight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated\\ninto today\\'s most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.\\n\\n     You told us in the 60\\'s that a new form of launch vehicle - a\\nsingle stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You\\nadvocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are\\nall great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You\\nconvinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld\\nits components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a\\nprime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the\\ngeneration before you - the generation that built transcontinental\\naviation in the 1920\\'s and 30\\'s - build a little and test a little\\nand Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who\\nstarted this program for the SDI.\\n\\n     Douglas Aircraft didn\\'t start with a DC-10.  They didn\\'t even\\nstart with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a\\nlittle - even sold a little and made a little money - before they\\nmoved on to the next step.  They didn\\'t take a decade or more\\nbefore putting the first \"rubber on the road.\"  Max Hunter - you\\ndidn\\'t take ten years to build Thor, and by God we\\'re not going to\\ntake ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable\\naerospace transportation is real.\\n\\n     We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same\\nteam here today but a few years to show through the Strategic\\nDefense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us -\\nlaunched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about\\na year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our\\ncommitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet\\nUnion.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored\\nthe importance of our work in bringing about a new international\\nrelationship.\\n\\n     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the\\nframework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the\\nnext generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.\\n\\n     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This\\nsummer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the\\nfirst time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three\\nyears a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space\\nrapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And\\nyes - we\\'ll make a little money off it too!\\n\\n     Then - and only then - we\\'ll spend another three years to\\nbuild a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of\\nspace will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the\\nrocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. \\nWhat a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to\\ncounter SDI merge to power mankind\\'s next step to the stars!\\n\\n     To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to\\nthe final answer.  Robert Goddard\\'s first rockets weren\\'t Saturn\\nV\\'s!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra\\ndollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital\\nsystem - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the\\nway.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket\\nexhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape the\\nworld again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks at\\nhand!\\n\\n     This project is real.  The torch of American technological\\ngreatness is being passed.  We are Americans.  This machine is\\nAmerican.  Let\\'s go fly it!\\n',\n",

However, expressing\\n    complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well\\n    defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far\\n    exceed their technical skills.\\n\\n    The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression\\n    tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and\\n    virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the\\n    observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of\\n    simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar\\n    representions, a confounded user asks: \"What does it all mean?\"\\n\\n    Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and\\n    ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by\\n    physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media\\n    radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic\\n    communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for\\n    composing imagery for understanding.\\n\\n    Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a\\n    breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the\\n    physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,\\n    psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and\\n    discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the\\n    computer graphics context.\\n\\n\\n    FEATURED SPEAKERS INCLUDE:\\n\\n        Psychology/Perception:\\n            Marc De May, University of Ghent\\n            Beverly J.

Some have offered to intercede in negotiations,\\nincluding a young man who will identify himself only as \"Bill\" and\\nclaims to be the \"MS-iah\".\\n\\nFormer members of the cult, some only recently deprogrammed, speak\\nhesitantly of their former lives, including being forced to work\\n20-hour days, and subsisting on Jolt and Twinkies.

It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science\\nCenter in Thousand Oaks, CA.\\n\\n   Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space\\nMaterials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell\\nInternational in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world\\nauthority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or\\ncoauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial\\nmaterials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David\\nCriswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.\\n\\n   Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal\\nexperts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build\\nthe Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a\\npotential to power the globe.\\n\\n   For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half\\nfrom California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific\\nconcept of a solar power system based on the Moon.\\n\\n   The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar\\nsurface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted\\nthrough orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous\\nsource of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth\\'s ever\\nincreasing demand using proven, basic technology.\\n\\n   OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space\\nIndustrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the\\nNational Space Society, which is an international non-profit\\norganization that promotes development of the space frontier.\\nThe Ventura County chapter is based in Oxnard, CA.\\n\\n       WHERE:  Rockwell Science Center Auditorium, 1049 Camino\\n               Dos Rios, Thousand Oaks, CA.\\n\\n   DIRECTIONS: Ventura Freeway 101 to Thousand Oaks, exit onto\\n               Lynn Road heading North (right turn from 101\\n               North, Left turn from 101 South), after about 1/2\\n               mile turn Left on Camino Dos Rios, after about 1/2\\n               mile make First Right into Rockwell after Camino\\n               Colindo, Parking at Top of Hill to the Left\\n\\n',\n",

If one of these\\nlocations is impossible (because, say, the Earth blocked that part of the \\nsky), voila, you have an error box.\\n\\nBATSE, by having 8 detectors of its own, can do its own location determination,\\nbut only to within about 3 degrees (would someone at GSFC, like David, like\\nto comment on the current state of location determination?).

We also know something about VR from ABC news magazine and\\n|> Computer Graphics World magazine.\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects\\nfor both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer\\ngraphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each\\nframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render on\\nhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics\\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames\\nper second).\\n\\n\\n|> \\n|> We certainly want to know more about VR.  Who are the leading\\n|> companies,\\n|> agencies, universities?  What machines support VR (i.e. SGI, Sun4,\\n|> HP-9000, BIM-6000, etc.)?\\n\\n\\nIt depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.\\nTrue immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual\\ndatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This\\nis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot\\ntraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of\\nthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion\\nof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system\\nmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex\\ndata representations.\\n\\nAdditionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15\\nframes per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps\\ndue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was\\nvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the\\ngraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant\\nframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general\\ndoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the\\nUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time\\noperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. \\nUniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time\\noperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not\\neven SGI\\'s uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our\\nmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due\\nto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.\\n\\nFrom a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments\\nrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time\\nmulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems\\non the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2\\nsystems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly\\nimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an\\nunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.\\n\\n\\n|>  What kind of graphics languages are used with VR\\n|> (GL, opengl, Phigs, PEX, GKS, etc.)?\\n\\nYou can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop\\nVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

As a rule of thumb, SGI platforms live for about 4-5\\nyears. This was true of the motorola-based 3000 series (\\'85-\\'89), the PI\\n(\\'88-\\'93), the Professional Series (the early 4D\\'s - \\'86-\\'90), the Power\\nSeries parallel systems (\\'88-\\'93). Individual CPU subsystems running at a\\nparticular clock rate usually live for about 2 years.

It is not bad error to program a program for 8bit images only\\nat that time, but when 24bit image formats are included to program the\\nwhole design should be changed to support 24bit images.\\nThat were not done and now we have\\n -the program violate jpeg design (and any 24bit image format)\\n -the program has human interface errors.\\n\\nOtherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 24bit format without\\nclearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use.\\n\\n[ ..deleted.. ]\\n\\n==clip==\\n\\nSome new items follows.\\n\\n==clip==\\n\\nI have seen that XV quantizes the image sometimes poorly with -best24\\noption than with default option we have.\\nThe reason surely is the quantizer used as -best24; it is (surprise)\\nthe same than used in ppmquant.\\n\\nIf you remember, I have tested some quantizers. In that test I found\\nthat rlequant (with default) is best, then comes djpeg, fbmquant, xv\\n(our default) in that order. In my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly\\n-- it actually gave image with bad artifacts.\\n\\nI don't know is ppmquant improved any, but I expect no.\\nSo, use of XV's -best24 option is not very good idea.\\n\\nI suggest that author of XV changes the quantizer to the one used in\\nrlequant -- I'm sure rle-people gives permission.\\n(Another could be one used in ImageMagick; I have not tested it, so I\\ncan say nothing about it.)\\n\\n==clip==\\n\\n==clip==\\n\\nSome minor bugs in human interface are:\\n\\nKey pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer; Often it happens\\nthat I make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong\\nplace.

Those key pressings\\nthen go to XV and image has gone or something weird.\\n\\nIn the color editor, when I turn a color meter and release it, XV\\nupdates the images. It is impossible to change all RGB values first\\nand then get the updated image.

Both spacecraft will team up with\\nground-based radio telescopes located around the world to create\\na radio telescope network that astronomers hope will expand radio\\ntelescope observing power by a factor of 10.\\n     Japan\\'s VSOP satellite will use a limited six-hour orbit to\\nconduct imaging science, while the Russian RADIOASTRON spacecraft\\nwill exploit a larger, 28-hour Earth orbit to conduct exploratory\\nradio astronomy. Each satellite will point at a source target for\\nroughly 24 hours, while approximately 20 ground-based radio\\ntelescopes will simultaneously point at the same source object\\nwhile within view on Earth.\\n     According to Dr. Joel Smith, JPL\\'s project manager for the\\nU.S. Space VLBI, meetings like those held at JPL will permit\\nJapan and Russia, who have little previous experience in radio\\ninterferometry, to establish working relationships with the radio\\nastronomy communities that will be vital during the complex\\nobservations required by the Space VLBI project.\\n     \"One of our main activities is developing the methodology\\nfor international coordination, because the two spacecraft\\nsimultaneously rely on the corresponding tracking stations while\\nusing the ground-based radio telescopes to observe the same\\ncelestial objects,\" said Smith.\\n     Three new tracking antennas are being built at DSN\\nfacilities and other three other tracking facilities located in\\nJapan, Russia and Green Bank, W.Va. This global network of\\nground-based radio telescopes will use precision clocks and\\nhigh-speed recorders to collect observation data and forward the\\ninformation to a correlator located at the National Radio\\nAstronomy Observatory in Socorro, N.M. The correlator will\\ncombine and process data, then make it available to mission\\ninvestigators in Moscow, Tokyo, and JPL via electronic mail.\\n     Smith is optimistic that the massive radio telescope created\\nby the Space VLBI network will provide radio astronomers with\\nbetter resolution than has ever been achieved before by\\nground-based radio telescopes, allowing astronomers to take a\\ncloser look at distant objects in space.\\n     \"There is a long history of radio astronomy using\\nground-based telescopes,\" said Smith. \"What we intend to do is to\\nextend radio astronomy into Earth orbit. Our goal is to look\\ndeeper into the cores of galactic nuclei, quasars and other\\nactive radio sources to understand what drives those things we\\nhave seen so far with radio astronomy.\"\\n     Smith noted that if one examines \"the active galactic\\nnuclei, you\\'ll find jets appearing to spew at speeds greater than\\nlight, and at energy levels that are millions of times greater\\nthan you would expect.\"\\n     He said some astronomers believe that black holes may be\\nlocated in the cores of these galaxies, and that they may fuel\\nthe jets. Smith hopes that \"by using Space VLBI to look further\\ninto the cores, this theory may be supported or disproved.\"\\n     Russian space-flight hardware, including transponders and\\ntransmitters, are now being tested in the United States, and\\nJapanese hardware is scheduled to arrive for testing later this\\nyear. Analysis of this hardware will permit U.S. scientists and\\nengineers to understand how to modify the high-speed VLBA\\nCorrelator operating at the NRAO in order to accommodate the odd\\ndata patterns that will originate from the more than 20\\nground-based radio telescopes involved in Space VLBI.\\n     Smith is particularly pleased that meetings with the\\nJapanese and Russian space agency officials -- like those held at\\nJPL in March -- have proceeded smoothly. Yet he knows that the\\npolitical uncertainty in Russia could jeopardize that country\\'s\\nparticipation in the project.\\n     \"Nothing is ever smooth,\" he said, \"but the Russians have\\nbeen incredibly open with us. We always anticipated some\\nlikelihood that we will not succeed because of political factors\\nbeyond our control, yet there tends to be a way of keeping these\\nthings going, because scientists on both sides are trying hard,\\nand people recognize the value of cooperation at this level.\"\\n     Smith points out that the Japanese space agency has more at\\nstake than just fulfilling an international commitment to a\\nscience mission.\\n     \"The Japanese have been extremely cooperative, since\\ninternational cooperation is essential to their science mission,\"\\nhe said.\\n     But Smith also noted that Japanese space agency officials\\nlook at the U.S. Space VLBI mission as an opportunity to showcase\\nthe technology involved with VSOP spacecraft, and their highly\\nregarded Mach V launch vehicle.\\n     Yet regardless of the risks involved in undertaking such an\\nambitious project, JPL\\'s Smith is satisfied that planning for the\\nSpace VLBI Project is beyond the significant financial and\\npolitical hurdles that otherwise might threaten the project.\\n     \"Fortunately, we have the virtue of having two partners, and\\nif either falls out, we would still have something with the\\nother. By themselves, both spacecraft are independent,\\nscientifically exciting missions.\"\\n                           ###\\n     ___    _____     ___\\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\\\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\\n    | | | |  __ \\\\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\\n\\n',\n",

I'm writing a program to convert .dxf files to a database\\nformat used by a 3D graphics program I've written.  My program stores\\nthe points of a polygon in CCW order.  I've used 3D Concepts a \\nlittle and it seems that the points are stored in the order\\nthey are drawn.\\n\\nDoes the DXF format have a way of indicating which order the \\npoints are stored in, CW or CCW?  Its easy enough to convert,\\nbut if I don't know which way they are stored, I dont know \\nwhich direction the polygon should be visible from.\\n\\nIf DXF doesn't handle this, can anyone recommend a workaround?\\nThe best I can think of is to create two polygons for each one\\nin the DXF file, one stored CW and the other CCW.  But that\\ndoubles the number of polygons and decreases speed...\\n\\nThanks in advance for any help,\\n\\nPatrice\\nhugo@hydra.unm.edu \\n\",\n",

That was my point all along, Fred.\\n\\n>>>>Not only\\n>>>>do you do the same thing on the net (honestly reporting your ideas\\n>>>>on matters of policy and projects in space), but your response was just\\n>>>>baiting, not even part of a debate.\\n\\n>>>I have yet to see Nick enter into anything remotely resembling \"a\\n>>>debate\".  I see him flame anyone or anything who disagrees with The\\n>>>One True Szabo Plan; I see him attacking people, calling them \"lazy\\n>>>bastard\" because they had the temerity to disagree with the Almight\\n>>>Nick; I see him questioning peoples ethics, again because they had the\\n>>>temerity to disagree with Lord God Szabo.  But debate?  BWAAaaahhhaaaa.\\n\\n>>I\\'m glad you can laugh, since your ratio of debate/insult is about the same.\\n\\n>Not even close, Tommy, and generally only when I\\'m dealing with\\n>someone like Nick.\\n\\nI see we are dealing with a problem in a conflict of interpretations, not\\nleast of which is your belief that only you can adequately judge what is\\nand is not debate.  Suffice to say that I disagree with you on that last\\npoint.  Why don\\'t you take a poll, Fred, if you want some psuedo-objective\\npoint-of-view?\\n\\nAnd, as usual, you defend your insults with \"he started it.\"  \"Yeah, I\\ntook some of his research and called it my own, but he started it.\"  \"So\\nwhat if I stole his car, he stole my lawnmower first.\"  Besides that, I\\nthink it\\'s still open to interpretation whether Nick actually did start it.\\nSo your defense, besides being lame, and contradicting the first part of\\nthe sentence in which it occurs, may not even apply anyway.\\n\\nYour defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrowed tool:  \"I\\nnever borrowed it, I already gave it back, and it was broken when you\\ngave it to me.\"  Make up yer mind, Fred!\\n\\n>>>>I\\'m not convinced that people are necessary in all parts of every space-\\n>>>>based process, and your response doesn\\'t tell me a thing about the\\n>>>>reasons why you think they should be, except to impune the motives of\\n>>>>the person with a divergent opinion.\\n\\n>>>Who said I think they should be, Tommy?

Then, I point out that I am\\nnot clear what you did mean, rather than risking your childish ire, wrongly\\ninterpreting you a second time, and I\\'m stupid for it.  I just can\\'t win,\\ncan I, Fred?  You\\'ve got a great point here somewhere, it\\'s just that\\nbetween stupid people that you must insult, and your jealous guarding of\\nyour valuable opinions, you never actually get around to making it.\\n\\n>Please quote the \\'it\\' I took issue with.  I believe you will see (if\\n>you look) that what I was and am taking issue with is Mr Szabo\\'s idea\\n>that the manned program should be scrapped until such time as his\\n>toaster-based infrastructure is finished.  All Hail the Szabo Plan!\\n\\n*** Fred issue #2;  Nick\\'s alleged meaning ***\\n\\nToo bad the plan only exists in your mind, instead of Nick\\'s, or you\\nwould have a really good point.  Instead you have provided a good reason\\nto ignore your insults, since they are based on incorrect interpretations\\nthat you have made about others.  Forgive me for giving your insults more\\nmeaning than they ever should have had.\\n\\nMy reading of what Nick actually said is that \"people aren\\'t required in\\nall parts of all space processes\", so your taking issue with his opinions\\nregarding people in the space program, I read as \"People are required in\\nall parts of all space processes.\"  So, help me out, here, Fred, since I\\'m\\nso patently stupid.  Did you read Nick wrong?  Or are you going to eat\\nyour terminal now?  If the latter, I sure hope it\\'s one of those Cheeto and\\nstring models that all the computer mags have been raving about :-)\\n\\nThe point is, _I_ am not stupid because of _your_ incorrect assumption.  I\\'d\\nonly be stupid if I insulted you for having made it.  But, alas, that\\'s your\\njob, Fred.\\n\\nAnd, finally, your style is confusing, since you tried to make two points,\\nsimultaneously, with an allegory/insult.  Sadly, one point addressed a \\'plan\\'\\nthat only existed in your mind, and the other took issue with behaviors that\\nyou do as much as anyone.\\n\\n>More deliberate lack of understanding, Tommy?\\n\\nNo, no, I finally got it.  You don\\'t like the plan that Nick\\'s posts made\\nyou imagine.  And you don\\'t like Nick\\'s obnoxious behavior, even though\\nit\\'s no worse than your own.  Thanks for taking the time with someone as\\ndense as myself.\\n\\n>>>>If you have a problem with Nick\\'s delivery, address that.  The way you\\n>>>>bait, you\\'re perpetuating the lack of discourse that you complain of.\\n\\n>>>No, Tommy, the \\'bait\\' is that which elicits the response.  *NICK*\\n>>>\\'baits\\'; I just flame him for being an obnoxious fool.\\n\\n>>I don\\'t really care who started it.  I read this list to get information\\n>>and other\\'s views on the issues to which it was dedicated, not to be\\n>>your Mom (He started it!

It\\'s\\njust amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that\\'s\\nno worse than your own.\\n\\nLet\\'s see here, my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical,\\nwhile your flames against people you decide are flamers isn\\'t, and my\\ncomplaints about your name-calling are immature, while your name-calling\\nisn\\'t.

In\\n    general, however, systems connected to \\'the net\\' fall in one of three\\n    categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent\\n    between these networks, and other resources available on one of these\\n    networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to\\n    special \\'servers\\'.\\n\\n    The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of\\n    several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.\\n\\n    One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central\\n    distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In\\n    addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for\\n    Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more\\n    specialized mailing lists described below.\\n\\n    A second mechanism is Usenet \\'netnews\\'. This is somewhat like a bulletin\\n    board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews\\n    separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a\\n    \\'group name\\'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are\\n    called \\'sci.space.news\\', \\'sci.space\\', \\'sci.space.shuttle\\', \\'sci.astro\\',\\n    and \\'talk.politics.space\\'. Contributors \\'post\\' submissions (called\\n    \\'articles\\' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends\\n    it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby\\n    machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so\\n    that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet\\n    sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was\\n    posted.\\n\\n    Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and\\n    BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not\\n    accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more\\n    flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make\\n    it the preferred option.\\n\\nMAILING LISTS\\n\\n    SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the\\n    International Space University (in only its second change of management\\n    in over a decade). Email space-request@isu.isunet.edu (message body\\n    should be in the format \\'subscribe space John Public\\') to join. Note\\n    that the moderated SPACE Magazine list is defunct at present for lack of\\n    a moderator. Old copies of SPACE Digest since its inception in 1981 are\\n    available by anonymous FTP. Retrieve\\n\\tjulius.cs.qub.ac.uk:pub/SpaceDigestArchive/README\\n    for further details.\\n\\n    Elements is a moderated list for fast distribution of Space Shuttle\\n    Keplerian Elements before and during Shuttle flights. NASA two line\\n    elements are sent out on the list from Dr. Kelso, JSC, and other sources\\n    as they are released. Email to elements-request@telesoft.com to join.\\n\\n    GPS Digest is a moderated list for discussion of the Global Positioning\\n    System and other satellite navigation positioning systems. Email to\\n    gps-request@esseye.si.com to join.\\n\\n    Space-investors is a list for information relevant to investing in\\n    space-related companies. Email Vincent Cate (vac@cs.cmu.edu) to join.\\n\\n    Space-tech is a list for more technical discussion of space topics;\\n    discussion has included esoteric propulsion technologies, asteroid\\n    capture, starflight, orbital debris removal, etc. Email to\\n    space-tech-request@cs.cmu.edu to join. Archives of old digests and\\n    selected excerpts are available by anonymous FTP from\\n    gs80.sp.cs.cmu.edu (128.2.205.90) in /usr/anon/public/space-tech,\\n    or by email to space-tech-request if you don\\'t have FTP access.\\n\\n    SEDS-L is a BITNET list for members of Students for the Exploration and\\n    Development of Space and other interested parties. Email\\n    LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET with a message saying \"SUBSCRIBE SEDS-L your\\n    name\". Email saying \"INDEX SEDS-L\" to list the archive contents.\\n\\n    SEDSNEWS is a BITNET list for news items, press releases, shuttle status\\n    reports, and the like. This duplicates material which is also found in\\n    Space Digest, sci.space, sci.space.shuttle, and sci.astro. Email\\n    LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET saying \"SUBSCRIBE SEDSNEWS your name\" to join.\\n    Email saying \"INDEX SEDSNEWS\" to list the archive contents.\\n\\n    Ron Baalke (baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov) runs a mailing list which\\n    carries the contents of the sci.space.news Usenet group.

Hawking, whose theories attempt to\\nexplain the origin of distant galaxies, black holes and alternate\\ndimensions, wanted to re-visit JPL, he explained, \"because while\\nI\\'m most interested in those things in space that are farther\\naway, I know that here is where the first steps are taken.\"\\n     Hawking, who was accompanied by his family, two graduate\\nstudents and his aides, began the tour in von Karman Auditorium,\\nas David Evans, deputy assistant Lab director in the Office of\\nFlight Projects, and Dr. Arden Albee, Mars Observer\\'s project\\nscientist, briefed him on current and past flight projects.\\n     Voyager was pointed out to him, with special attention paid\\nto a gold plate with a series of engraved images. Should\\nextraterrestrial life stumble upon the spacecraft, Evans noted,\\nthey would find a variety of images that would explain something\\nof Earth. The professor asked if we were still communicating with\\nthe spacecraft, and Evans affirmed that we are.\\n     Using a model of Mars Observer, Albee spent several minutes\\ndescribing the project and the spacecraft\\'s features. In answer\\nto a question from Hawking, Chahine described a proposed\\ndrag-free satellite, but confirmed that at this point, \"it\\'s only\\na concept.\" Chahine, who had met Hawking at Caltech about five\\nyears before, described the professor as \"a living miracle of the\\npower of the brain. He\\'s miraculous, and he has such a good sense\\nof humor.\"\\n     The next stop, a demonstration on scientific data\\nvisualization in Section 384\\'s Digital Image Animation Lab,\\nentertained and delighted the group, as everyone donned goggles\\nto view 3-D images of Mars. Project Scientist Dr. Eric De Jong\\nshowed off the latest data -- a comet that had only recently been\\ndiscovered in orbit close to Jupiter. Hawking was curious about\\nits composition, and as he was shown how images are developed, he\\nasked several questions on their interpretation.\\n     Norman Haynes, ALD, Office of Telecommunications and Data\\nAcquisition, briefed the professor on the Space Flight Operations\\nFacility, and then Hawking spoke with Stone.\\n     The day ended with two technical discussions of particular\\ninterest to the professor. Technical Group Leader Dr. Frank\\nEstabrook and Senior Research Scientist Hugo Wahlquist described\\na three-spacecraft gravity wave experiment, currently under way.\\nThen planetary astronomer Dr. Richard Terrile explained the\\nphilosophy and plans for extra solar system planetary detection.\\n     The Hawking party, which had been visiting Southern\\nCalifornia for five weeks, was headquartered at Caltech, and\\nplanned to leave for England within a few weeks after the Lab\\ntour. Upon departing, the Cambridge-based scientist promised\\nChahine that he would return to JPL for another visit.\\n                          ###\\n     ___    _____     ___\\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\\\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\\n    | | | |  __ \\\\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\\n\\n',\n",

I\\'ve \\ntranscribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means\\ninfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is \\ngranted to copy this without restriction.\\n\\nNote for newbies:  The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing a\\nsingle staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle.  The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3\\nscale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO.  It is \\ncurrently undergoing tests.  The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale \\nexperimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded.\\n\\nOn April 6th, Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled \\n\"Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions\" here at the University of\\nIllinois. Mr Nelson\\'s job involves using software to simulate trajectories and\\ndetermine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he is\\nnot directly involved with the Delta Clipper project, he has spent time with \\nthem recently, using his software for their applications.  He thus used \\nthe DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I don\\'t think the details\\nof implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hope\\nthey aren\\'t - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you will\\nbe interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.\\n\\nThe first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  The\\nmain restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume that\\nthis is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but I\\ndid not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boosters\\nand 4 sustainers.  The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in \\nmid-flight.  Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.  Mr Nelson\\nshowed the following plot of acceleration vs time:\\n                  ______\\n3 G         /|   /      |\\n           / |  /       |          As ASCII graphs go, this is actually fairly \\n          /  | /        |\\t   good.  The big difference is that the lines\\n2 G      /   |/         |          made by the  /  should be curves which are\\n        /               |          concave up.  The data is only approximate, as\\n       /                |          the graph wasn\\'t up for very long.\\n1 G   /                 |\\n                        |\\n                        |\\n0 G                     |\\n\\n             ^          ^\\n           ~100 sec    ~400 sec\\n\\n\\nAs mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below\\n3.  Initially, all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel the\\naccelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are \\nthrotled back.  However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so it\\nsoon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in \\naccelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer engines\\nbring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut\\nout entirely.\\n\\nThe engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimed\\nfor an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of\\nair drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to \\nthat desired.\\n\\nQuestions from the audience:  (paraphrased)\\n\\nQ:  Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than\\n    all at once?\\n\\nA:  Very perceptive.  Worth considering.  They have not yet done the simulation.    Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given.\\n\\nQ:  So what was the final payload for this trajectory?\\n\\nA:  Can\\'t tell us.  \"Read Aviation Leak.\"  He also apparently had a good \\n    propulsion example, but was told not to use it.  \\n\\nMy question:  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protecting\\nnational security or MD protecting their own interests?\\n\\nThe second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitch\\nup maneuver.  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and \\nthe parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphs\\nof heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar,\\nand I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate.\\nThe end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would have\\nabout 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it\\'s reentry profile about \\n60 degrees south latitude.\\n\\nI would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didn\\'t know about that\\naspect of the flight profile.\\n\\n-- \\nJosh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\\n\\t\\t    \"Find a way or make one.\"\\n\\t             -attributed to Hannibal\\n',\n",

When work for a large program like\\n   Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the\\n   center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts\\n   to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the\\n   center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to\\n   be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about\\n   that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10\\n   billion won\\'t be spent on anything having anything\\n   to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion\\n   was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn\\'t), but the work done\\n   with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting\\n   the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the\\n   existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the\\n   term \\'center tax\\'. They look at the Station they are\\n   getting and the price they are paying and note that\\n   it doesn\\'t add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware\\n   that a third of the money is going for something else.\"\\n\\nMy dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A couple\\nof weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, I\\ntalked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station\\nat Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn\\'t post a\\nresponse immediately, I do have a real job I\\'m supposed\\nto be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHz\\ndata & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty low\\non the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekend\\nin Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers \\nAssociation conference, extolling the virtues of SSF\\nto 15,000 science teachers.]\\n\\nFirst off, yes, the concept of \\'center tax\\', or \\'wrap\\' does\\nexist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total \\'tax\\'\\nfor the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million.\\nThis was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4\\ncenter \\'taxes\\'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at\\n$2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is\\n04/2.2 = 1.8%\\n\\nOver the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30\\nbillion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to\\n$540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but I\\nwill concede it\\'s still an appreciable amount of pocket\\nchange.\\n\\nI should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could\\nbe close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on funds\\nthat are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at some\\nstates, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat\\nthe food at the restaurant, but you don\\'t if you get it\\ntake-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the funds\\nwe receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT*\\nsubject to the center tax (I don\\'t have the numbers in\\nfront of me, but I\\'d guess at least 95% of the WP-4 funds\\ngo to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a tax\\nrate of 1/3, but it\\'s only applied to funds spent at the\\ncenter, and not to the prime contracts.\\n\\nThis leads to the obvious question \"What is the government\\ndoing with SSF funds that don\\'t go to the prime contractors?\\n(i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. A\\nbig portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happens\\nto the balance of the funds, which aren\\'t eaten\\nup by the center tax?)\"\\n\\nAt WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting\\ndevelopment funds (as they are supporting the development\\nwork done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds to\\nsetup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical\\npower system architecture. Our testbed has a real life\\nsolar array field (left over from solar cell research\\nresearch a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries\\n(to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DC\\nswitchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulated\\nloads. Data from the testbed was used in a recent\\nchange evaluation involving concerns about the stability\\nof the power system.\\n\\nWe have also used the supporting development money to\\npurchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on life\\ntesting at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in\\nIndiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells on\\ntest recently hit the four year life test milestone.\\n38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the\\non-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).\\n\\nAs a final example, my \\'home\\' division at Lewis used\\nthe supporting development funds to purchase personal\\ncomputers and work stations, for performing system\\nanalyses (like modeling of the performance of the\\nelectrical power system, availability calculations\\nusing a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a \\ndatabase with information on weight of the power\\nsystem elements).\\n\\nFinally, the money raised by the \\'tax\\' does not all\\ngo into a \\'slush fund.\\' At Lewis, the director\\ndoes control a small discretionary fund. Each year,\\nany individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to\\nthe director to get money from this fund to look\\nat pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.\\n\\nMost of the tax, however, goes to fund the \\'general\\'\\nservices at the Center, like the library, the \\ncentral computer services division, the Contractor \\nwho removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is rather\\ndifficult to determine what percentage of the\\nSSF budget doesn\\'t go for SSF activities. To get\\nan accurate figure, you would have to take\\nthe annual expenditure for the library (for example),\\nand then divide by the amount of the library funds\\nused to support SSF (which would be hard to\\ncompute by itself - how would you figure out\\nwhat percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for\\n1 year is \\'billable\\' to SSF, would you base it on\\nthe person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-week\\nversus the rest of the center personnel). You would\\nthen have to compare this estimate of the SSF\\nportion of the library expense with the portion of\\nthe tax that goes to support the library. Who knows,\\nmaybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, but\\nwe underpay for snow removal? Talk about\\na burecratic nightmare!\\n\\nMy last point is that I can\\'t believe your claim that\\nCongress has never heard of the term \\'center tax.\\'\\nUnfortunately, all of the NASA testimony before\\nCongress isn\\'t on a computer, so I can\\'t do a simple\\nword search someplace to prove you wrong. But surely,\\nin some GAO audit somewhere, these NASA cost methods\\nwere documented for Congress?\\n',\n",

The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology\\ndemonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO)\\nrocket ship.\\n\\n        The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands\\nMissile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in\\nmid-June.\\n\\n        Although there wasn\\'t a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for\\nSSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60\\nmillion for the DC-X -- can\\'t itself afford to fund full development of a\\nfollow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for\\na sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government\\nagencies.\\n\\n        SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for\\norbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent\\nchanges in SDI\\'s political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO\\nless of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as\\na step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.\\n\\n        SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies,\\nsaid Col.  Simon \"Pete\" Worden, SDIO\\'s deputy for technology.  But Worden\\ndeclined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the\\nprogram. \"I didn\\'t make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I\\nhave available to spend,\" he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell\\nDouglas Astronautics headquarters.\\n\\n        While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program\\'s orbital\\nobjective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the \"better,\\nfaster, cheaper\" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes\\nthis philosophy can produce breakthroughs that \"leapfrog\" ahead of\\nevolutionary technology developments.\\n\\n        Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a \"build a little, test a\\nlittle\" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said\\nthe program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months --\\nshowed how today\\'s engineers could move beyond the \"miracles of our\\nparents\\' time.\"\\n\\n        \"The key is management,\" Worden said. \"SDIO had a very light hand\\non this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable.\"\\n\\n        Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said\\nlean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be\\ncrucial. \"It\\'s essential we do not end up with a large management\\nstructure where the price goes up exponentially.\"\\n\\n        SDIO\\'s approach also won praise from two California members of the\\nHouse Science, Space and Technology Committee. \"This is the direction\\nwe\\'re going to have to go,\" said Rep.  George Brown, the committee\\'s\\nDemocratic chairman. \"Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren\\'t\\nsustainable....NASA hasn\\'t learned it yet.  SDIO has.\"\\n\\n        Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown\\'s Republican colleague, went further.\\nJoking that \"a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,\"\\nRohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it\\nwere left to the civil space agency.\\n\\n        Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell\\nDouglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged\\nrockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. \"Let\\'s not\\nbuild fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let\\'s build a spaceship!\"\\n\\n         Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO\\'s sponsorship, he said the\\nprivate sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.\\n\\n        McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its\\nC-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious\\nabout a large private secotro commitment. \"On very large ventures,\\ncompanies put in seed money,\" said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas\\'\\nsenior vice president for space systems. \"You need strong government\\ninvestments.\"\\n\\n        While the government and industry continue to differ on funding\\nfor the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to\\ndevelopment.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas\\nAircraft\\'s DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for\\nthe DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could\\neventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).\\n\\n        Flight tests this summer at White Sands will \"expand the envelope\"\\nof performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The\\nfirst tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle\\ntake-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to\\n5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000\\nfeet.\\n\\n        Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final\\ntests will include a \"pitch-over\" manever that rotates the vehicle back\\ninto a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.\\n\\n        The flight test series will be supervised by Charles \"Pete\"\\nConrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing.\\nNow a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles\\naircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated\\ncheck-out and access panels for easy maintainance.\\n\\n        If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will\\nbecome a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the\\nPratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquid\\nhydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of\\nthrust\\n\\n        Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 model\\nhas a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on\\nthrottling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid\\nturnaround.\\n\\n        Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ\\ntri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union.\\nThe resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and\\nthen switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.\\n\\n        The mechanism for the teaming may already be in place.  Pratt has\\na technology agreement with NPO Energomash, the design bureau responsible\\nfor the tri-propellant and Energia cryogenic engines.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

If the number is odd,\\nthen it is inside. Of cause, you have to deal with the special cases which\\nmay make you headache.\\n\\nThe second method is PI algorithm. Draw the lines between the point and\\nall the vertices on the polygon. Calculate and sum the angles of the\\nsuccessive lines. If the result is 2*PI, then it is inside. If PI, then\\nit is on the polygon. Otherwise it is outside.\\n\\nMy experience tells the second method is relible.\\n\\nHope this helps.\\n\\nYeh\\nUSC\\n',\n",

Unlike the conventional large \\nVHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed \\nto individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier \\nfeeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast \\nbeam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the \\nantenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal \\ndivision/combination are performed at a low signal level using \\nelectronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna \\nbeam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the \\nzenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element \\nis crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful \\ncalibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna \\nelement was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for \\nthis purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to \\nmake a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern \\nmonitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific \\nsatellite OHZORA (EXOS-C). A receiver named MUM (MU radar antenna \\nMonitor) on board the satellite measures a CW signal of 100 to 400 \\nwatts transmitted from the MU radar.

It is, however, closely regulated. In order to \\npurchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be\\none of the following:\\na) An employee of a government agency.\\nb) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets.\\nc) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in\\nresearch or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations: \\nThe Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry.\\nMembers of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction\\nand flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.\\n\\nThe FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any \\norganization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions \\nto avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are:\\n- Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the\\nlocation, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL. \\n- The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft\\nwithin the operating radius around the launch site.\\n- Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited.\\n- The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that\\nunmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.\\n\\nMost of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year)\\nare held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the\\nwestern deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular\\nsince it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).\\n\\nThe two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members\\'\\nuse, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is\\nfrom 50 to 500 or more feet. \\n\\nBy the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an \"F\" motor are exempt from\\nmost Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart\\nC, for details.\\n\\nAs for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to\\n50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical\\nrocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute,\\nor multiple parachutes, depending on the payload.

They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on\\n    microfilm.\\n\\n    The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it\\n    is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960\\'s vintage hardware (like\\n    guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB\\n    have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch\\n    from.\\n\\n    By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify\\n    the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean\\n    sheet design.\\n\\n\\n    WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN\\'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE\\n\\n    Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access\\n    for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an\\n    opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being\\n    \"scooped\" by people uninvolved in the mission.

Numerous studies claim that even in\\n    worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental\\n    reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.\\n    Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2\\n    RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather\\n    satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months\\n    with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar\\n    module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which\\n    was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in\\n    the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are\\n    expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10\\n    half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].\\n\\n    To make your own informed judgement, some references you may wish to\\n    pursue are:\\n\\n    A good review of the technical facts and issues is given by Daniel\\n    Salisbury in \"Radiation Risk and Planetary Exploration-- The RTG\\n    Controversy,\" *Planetary Report*, May-June 1987, pages 3-7.

Studies\\n    indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in\\n    absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The\\n    remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted\\n    study, Charles Jackman.\\n\\n    The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the\\n    stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was\\n    organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space\\n    Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia\\n    (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space\\n    Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and\\n    Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects\\n    of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.\\n\\n    The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:\\n\\n       Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year\\n\\t  Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year\\n\\t  Shuttle sources:\\t  725,000 kilograms/year\\n\\n    The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are\\n    launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the\\n    total stratospheric chlorine sources.\\n\\n    The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would\\n    be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability\\n    associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.\\n\\n    The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed\\n    by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally\\n    averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and\\n    Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch\\n    schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be\\n    increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about\\n    the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons\\n    do at the present time.\\n\\n    Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space\\n    Shuttle\\'s Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR\\n    Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W.

Holding your\\n    breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to\\n    watch out for when ascending, and you\\'ll have eardrum trouble if your\\n    Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal\\n    experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no\\n    immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do\\n    not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.\\n\\n    Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly \"the bends\", certainly some\\n    [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)\\n    start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from\\n    lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,\\n    you\\'re dying. The limits are not really known.\\n\\n    References:\\n\\n    _The Effect on the Chimpanzee of Rapid Decompression to a Near Vacuum_,\\n    Alfred G.

Dunn, eds, Report SAM-TR-65-48 (June 1965), USAF School\\n    of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Texas.\\n\\n\\n    HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED\\n\\n    The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is\\n    a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.\\n    What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank\\n    came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the\\n    astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin\\n    team\\'s medical/forensic report.\\n\\n    The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the\\n    water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks\\n    underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team\\n    examined them, they were sent off to be buried.\\n\\n\\n    USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT\\n\\n    You can\\'t use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit\\n    because it can\\'t get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry\\n    enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.\\n\\n    Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of\\n    that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in\\n    the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly\\n    specialized for travel between Earth\\'s surface and low orbit. Taking it\\n    higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would\\n    be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit\\n    spacecraft.\\n\\n    [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]\\n\\n\\n    THE \"FACE ON MARS\"\\n\\n    There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid\\n    face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:\\n    35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often\\n    published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13\\n    (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).\\n\\n    Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is\\n    artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an\\n    extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the\\n    resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a\\n    smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere\\n    on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don\\'t\\n    know the address) to study the Face.\\n\\n    The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution\\n    camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this\\n    question in a few years.

The split\\nbetween the train and test set is based upon a messages posted before\\nand after a specific date.\\n\\nThis module contains two loaders. The first one,\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups`,\\nreturns a list of the raw texts that can be fed to text feature\\nextractors such as :class:`~sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`\\nwith custom parameters so as to extract feature vectors.\\nThe second one, :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized`,\\nreturns ready-to-use features, i.e., it is not necessary to use a feature\\nextractor.\\n\\n**Data Set Characteristics:**\\n\\n    =================   ==========\\n    Classes                     20\\n    Samples total            18846\\n    Dimensionality               1\\n    Features                  text\\n    =================   ==========\\n\\nUsage\\n~~~~~\\n\\nThe :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function is a data\\nfetching / caching functions that downloads the data archive from\\nthe original `20 newsgroups website`_, extracts the archive contents\\nin the ``~/scikit_learn_data/20news_home`` folder and calls the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.load_files` on either the training or\\ntesting set folder, or both of them::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\')\\n\\n  >>> from pprint import pprint\\n  >>> pprint(list(newsgroups_train.target_names))\\n  [\\'alt.atheism\\',\\n   \\'comp.graphics\\',\\n   \\'comp.os.ms-windows.misc\\',\\n   \\'comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware\\',\\n   \\'comp.sys.mac.hardware\\',\\n   \\'comp.windows.x\\',\\n   \\'misc.forsale\\',\\n   \\'rec.autos\\',\\n   \\'rec.motorcycles\\',\\n   \\'rec.sport.baseball\\',\\n   \\'rec.sport.hockey\\',\\n   \\'sci.crypt\\',\\n   \\'sci.electronics\\',\\n   \\'sci.med\\',\\n   \\'sci.space\\',\\n   \\'soc.religion.christian\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.guns\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.mideast\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.misc\\',\\n   \\'talk.religion.misc\\']\\n\\nThe real data lies in the ``filenames`` and ``target`` attributes. The target\\nattribute is the integer index of the category::\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n  (11314,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n  (11314,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n  array([ 7,  4,  4,  1, 14, 16, 13,  3,  2,  4])\\n\\nIt is possible to load only a sub-selection of the categories by passing the\\nlist of the categories to load to the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function::\\n\\n  >>> cats = [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\', categories=cats)\\n\\n  >>> list(newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n  (1073,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n  (1073,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n  array([0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0])\\n\\nConverting text to vectors\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIn order to feed predictive or clustering models with the text data,\\none first need to turn the text into vectors of numerical values suitable\\nfor statistical analysis.

Many classifiers achieve very\\nhigh F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\\naren\\'t from this window of time.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\\nwhich is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\\n  >>> from sklearn import metrics\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.88213...\\n\\n(The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\\nthe training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\\nmultinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\\nyet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n  ...     feature_names = np.asarray(vectorizer.get_feature_names())\\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n  ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n  ...\\n  >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n- The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n  previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n  wrote:\"\\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n  were posting at the time.\\n\\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\nsame high level.\\n\\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.77310...\\n\\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.76995...\\n\\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try\\nrunning :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py` with and without\\nthe ``--filter`` option to compare the results.\\n\\n.. topic:: Recommendation\\n\\n  When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\\n  should strip newsgroup-related metadata. In scikit-learn, you can do this by\\n  setting ``remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``. The F-score will be\\n  lower because it is more realistic.\\n\\n.. topic:: Examples\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py`\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py`\\n'}"

The conference was organized by the Rensse-\\n          laer Design Research Center in co-operation with  IEEE  and  SIG-\\n          GRAPH.   Attendees  came  from five countries spanning three con-\\n          tinents.   A  good  cross-section  of  the  PHIGS  community  was\\n          represented  at this conference with participants including PHIGS\\n          users, workstation vendors, third-party PHIGS implementors, stan-\\n          dards  committee  members,  and  researchers  from  industry  and\\n          academia.  The opening speaker, Dr. Richard Puk, challenged PHIGS\\n          users  to  \"take  charge of your PHIGS\" by participating in PHIGS\\n          standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS\\n          implementors.    The   closing  speaker,  Dr.  Andries  Van  Dam,\\n          described his vision of the future of graphics standards  \"beyond\\n          PHIGS\".\\n\\n          Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the  following\\n          topics:  PHIGS  and  X, Application Toolkits, Application Issues,\\n          Texture Mapping, NURBS,  PHIGS  Extensions,  and  Object-Oriented\\n          Libraries and Frameworks.  Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX, PHIGS\\n          Non-Retained Data, Real-World CAD Applications Using  PHIGS,  and\\n          Portability  Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed\\n          a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences.

I was also\\nshocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by\\nabout 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer).  This seems huge, but is only\\n1/256 of the dynamic range.  In those terms it doesn\\'t seem so bad.  What\\nis happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, due\\nmainly to roundoff, I believe.  So the polygon is not planar in z, but is\\nmore like a Ruffles potato chip.  Ditto with lines.  When you start/end at\\ndifferent x/y values, the \"ridges\" are out of phase, resulting in the\\nstitch effect.  You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon\\nright on top of another, but with different vertices.  You will likely see\\na smeared effect where they overlap.\\n  Example:\\n  Try Polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100)\\n      Polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100)\\n\\nYour implementation is correct.  In fact, we do a similar trick when\\nrendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaces\\nwith isoparametric lines.  Without the trick, the lines appear stitched, as\\nyou say.  When the application draws lines/polygons independently, the\\nsystem does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so the\\napplication must do it.  This is what you have discovered and are doing.\\nBravo!\\n\\n(Note to IBM\\'ers:  The information given here has been previously disclosed\\nthrough proper channels so I\\'m not giving away any new unpublished info.)\\n\\n-- \\n  Mark Einkauf     [ einkauf@austin.ibm.com ]\\n  IBM - Advanced Workstations and Systems - Graphics Systems\\n  Austin TX\\n * Views and opinions expressed herein are not necessarily those of IBM Corp. *\\n',\n",

Gill\\n        graeme@labtam.oz.au\\n\\nDate: 93/5/16\\n\\n\\n\"What is all this gamma stuff anyway ?\"\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nAlthough it would be nice to think that \"an image is an image\",\\nthere are a lot of complications. Not only are there a whole bunch of\\ndifferent image formats (gif, jpeg, tiff etc etc), there is a whole\\nlot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit\\ncomplicated. Gamma is one of those things. If you\\'ve ever downloaded\\nimages from BBS or the net, you\\'ve probably noticed (with most image\\nviewing programs) that some images look ok, some look too dark, and some\\nlook too light. \"Why is this ?\" you may ask. This, is gamma correction\\n(or the lack of it).\\n\\nWhy do we need gamma correction at all ?\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nGamma correction is needed because of the nature of CRTs (cathode\\nray tubes - the monitors usually used for viewing images). If you\\nhave some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer\\nimage by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of\\nthe scene, then you have created a \"linear\" or un-gamma-corrected\\nimage. This is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate\\nthe image as if the values in the image file were light (ie. adding\\nand multiplying will work just like real light in the real world).\\nNow if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage\\nand feed it into a CRT, you find that the CRT _doesn\\'t_ give you\\nan amount of light proportional to the voltage. The amount of light\\ncoming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage\\nsomething like this:\\n\\nLight_out = voltage ^ crt_gamma\\n\\nSo if you just dump your nice linear image out to a CRT, the image\\nwill look much too dark. To fix this up you have to \"gamma correct\"\\nthe image first. You need to do the opposite of what the CRT\\nwill do to the image, so that things cancel out, and you get\\nwhat you want. So you have to do this to your image:\\n\\ngamma_corrected_image = image ^ (1/crt_gamma)\\n\\nFor most CRTs, the crt_gamma is somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0.\\n\\nIf that is all it is, why does it seem so complicated ?\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction.\\nAlso not all sources of images give you linear images (Video cameras\\nor video signals in general). Because of this, a lot of images\\nalready have some gamma correction done to them, and you are \\nrarely sure how much. If you try and display one of those images\\nwith a program that does gamma correction for you, the image gets\\ncorrected twice and looks way to light. If you display one of those\\nimages with a program that doesn\\'t do gamma correction, then it will\\nlook vaguely right, but not perfect, because the gamma correction is\\nnot exactly right for you particular CRT.\\n\\nWhose fault is all this ?\\n-----------------------\\n\\nIt is really three things. One is all those display programs\\nout there that don\\'t do gamma correction properly. Another is\\nthat most image formats don\\'t specify a standard gamma, or\\ndon\\'t have some way or recording what their gamma correction is.\\nThe third thing is that not many people understand what gamma\\ncorrection is all about, and create a lot of images with varying\\ngamma\\'s.\\n\\nAt least two file formats do the right thing.\\nThe Utah Graphics Toolkit .rle format has a semi-standard way of recording\\nthe gamma of an image. The JFIF file standard (that uses JPEG compression)\\nspecifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 (ie. a\\nlinear image - but not everyone obeys the rules).\\n\\nSome image loaders (for instance xli - an X11 image utility)\\nallow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you\\nare using, but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to\\nview. Other image viewers (eg. xv another X11 image program) and\\nutilities (eg. the pbm toolkit) provide ways of changing the gamma\\nof an image, but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction\\nyourself, allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has,\\nand then the gamma correction you need to suite your CRT monitor.\\n\\n[ Note that xv 2.21 doesn\\'t provide an easy way of modifying the\\ngamma of an image. You need to adjust the R, G and B curves to the\\nappropriate gamma in the ColEdit controls. Altering the Intensity\\nin the HSV controls doesn\\'t do the right thing, as it fails to\\ntake account of the effect gamma has on H and S. This tends\\nto give a tint to the image. ]\\n\\nHow can I figure out what my viewer does, or what gamma my screen has ?\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma.jpg\\n(provided with xli distribution), which is a JFIF jpeg format file\\ncontaining two grayscale ramps. The ramps are chosen to look linear\\nto the human eye, one using continuous tones, and the other using\\ndithering.  If your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects\\nimages, then the two ramps should look symmetrical, and the point\\nat which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half\\nway from the top to the bottom. (To find this point it helps if\\nyou move away a little from the screen, and de-focus your eyes a\\nbit.)\\n\\nIf your viewer doesn\\'t do gamma correction, then left hand ramp will have\\na long dark part and a short white part, and the point of equal brightness\\nwill be above the center.\\n\\nIf your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction\\nfor a display, then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the\\ngamma, and decrease it if it is below the center. The value will usually be\\naround 2.2 \\n\\n[with xli for instance, you can adjust the display gamma with the\\n-dispgamma flag, and once you\\'ve got it right, you can set the DISPLAY_GAMMA\\nenvironment variable in your .profile]\\n\\nHow do I figure out what the gamma of an image is ?\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is the most tricky bit. As a general rule it seems that a lot of\\ntrue color (ie. 24 bit, .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of\\n1.0 (linear), although there are many about that have some gamma\\ncorrection. It seems that the majority of pseudo color images\\n(ie. 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc.) are gamma corrected\\nto some degree or other.\\n\\nIf your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will\\nlook good, and gamma corrected images will look too light.\\n\\nIf your viewer doesn\\'t do gamma correction, then linear images will\\nlook too dark, and gamma corrected images will ok.\\n\\nWhy Linear images are sometimes not such a good thing\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOne of the reason that many high quality formats (such as\\nVideo) use gamma correction is that it actually makes better\\nuse of the storage medium. This is because the human\\neye has a logarithmic response to light, and gamma correction\\nhas a similar compression characteristic. This means images \\ncould make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance),\\nif they used gamma correction. The implication though, is that\\nevery time you want to do any image processing you should\\nconvert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain\\nthe same accuracy. Since little popular software does this, and\\nnone of the popular image formats can agree on a standard\\ngamma correction factor, it is difficult to justify gamma corrected\\nimages at the popular level.\\n\\nIf some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma,\\nand if image manipulation software takes care to use\\nextra precision when dealing with linearized internal data,\\nthen gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing.\\n\\n(I am told that the Kodak PhotoCD format for instance, has a\\nstandard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the\\nhighest quality out of the bits used to hold the image).\\n\\n###########################################################################\\n\\n\\n',\n",

First let me say that when I say \"intelligent\"\\nI mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level\\nwith, or greater than, human tool use and tool building. IE assuming\\nsuitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter \\nit\\'s enviroment in a planned way, it will do so. That\\'s certainly not\\na universal or complete definition of intelligence, but it will suffice\\nfor a putative technological alien.\\n\\nNow no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought, but\\nit\\'s generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level\\nof complexity. This is generally determined by the number of neuron\\ncells, and their interconnections. So a creature the size of a lemur\\nwouldn\\'t have enough neurons to support complex thought. This argument\\nis considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur. There\\'s room\\nfor a large brain, though no indication that one ever developed. One\\nreason this may be true is neuronic speed. The electrochemical messages \\nthat trigger neurons require time to propagate. This makes it difficult\\nfor a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very\\nlarge creatures. So there\\'s little selection pressure for such brains.\\nInstead, a simpler distributed network evolves. This doesn\\'t rule out\\nintelligent dinosaurs, but it points in that direction.\\n\\nThen there are the thermodynamic arguments. A tiny creature like the\\nlemur needs to eat frequently because it\\'s internal heat is rapidly\\nlost due to it\\'s high surface to volume ratio. I contend that a creature\\nthat must spend most of it\\'s time and energy feeding won\\'t have the time\\nto develop and exercise intelligence. That argument may be somewhat weak.\\nThe dinosaur\\'s problem is the reverse, it must moderate it\\'s heat production \\nbecause it\\'s high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat. \\nI\\'m assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical\\nreactivity reasons for productive neuron function. So creatures would\\ntend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that\\nof humans if they are carbon based. That tends to rule out cold blooded\\ncreatures as potential homes of intelligence. Some people contend that\\nsome of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded. But for a creature\\nthe size of a brontosaur, it\\'s activity levels would have to be restrained\\nor it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the\\nwaste heat. Whales are similar size, but they can reject heat to the\\nocean, a much more efficient sink than air. I suspect that for intelligence\\nto manifest itself, a certain degree of activity in interacting with the\\nenvironment is necessary. IE monkey curiousity. I doubt a large dinosaur\\nwould be capable of that much activity.\\n\\nGary\\n-- \\nGary Coffman KE4ZV          |    You make it,     | gatech!wa4mei!ke4zv!gary\\nDestructive Testing Systems |    we break it.     | uunet!rsiatl!ke4zv!gary\\n534 Shannon Way             |    Guaranteed!      | emory!kd4nc!ke4zv!gary \\nLawrenceville, GA 30244     |                     | \\n',\n",

On April 22 and 23, delta Differenced One-way Range (DOR) passes were\\nperformed over DSS-14/63 (Goldstone/Madrid 70 meter antennas) and DSS-14/43\\n(Goldstone/Canberra 70 meter antennas), respectively.  Initial results \\nindicate the delta DOR pass on April 22 was unsuccessful due to ground\\nstation hardware problems but the one on April 23 was successfully performed.\\n\\n2.  On April 23, a cruise science Memory Readout (MRO) was performed for the\\nMagnetometer (MAG) instrument.  Analysis indicates the data was received\\nproperly.\\n\\n3.  On April 23, the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the\\nspacecraft stored sequence.  These relays were commanded closed by the CDS\\n(Command Data Subsystem) prior to launch and were again commanded closed to\\npreclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relays/wiring being a\\nsource of internal electrostatic charge (IESD).\\n\\n4.  On April 26, cruise science Memory Readouts (MRO) were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\\nproperly.\\n\\n5.  During the period from April 26 to April 27, a navigation cycle was\\nperformed.  This navigation cycle provided near-continuous acquisition of\\ntwo-way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the\\nspacecraft over DSS-63, DSS-14, and DSS-43.\\n\\n6.  On April 26, real-time commands were sent to test slew the Radio Relay\\nAntenna (RRA) in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on April 28.\\nThe RRA was slewed from approximately 3.5 degrees from stow to approximately\\n20.3 degrees.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18\\ndegrees which was well within the predicted range.  The RRA was commanded back\\nto approximately 15.2 degrees from stow.  Preliminary analysis indicated the\\nantenna reached about 15.8 degrees also well within the predicted range.  The\\nRRA motor temperature was at 1 degree C at the start of the activity and had\\nincreased to 1.6 degrees C at its completion.\\n\\n     After verifying proper RRA slewing, the RRA slew test mini-sequence was\\nuplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April 28.  Upon successful uplink,\\na Delayed Action Command (DAC) was sent which will reposition the stator on\\nMay 4 to its initial pre-test position.  Also, a DAC was sent to turn the\\nTwo-Way Noncoherent (TWNC) on April 28 prior to the start of the RRA slew test\\nmini-sequence.\\n\\n7.  On April 27, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to\\n264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\\n\\n8.  On April 28, the RRA slew test executed nominally.  The spacecraft under\\nstored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about 16 degrees\\nfrom stow and going to 53 degrees, back to 25 degrees, then to 51 degrees,\\nback to 22 degrees, then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees.  All of\\nthe slews were well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was\\nat 2.3 degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4\\ndegrees C at its completion.  After completion of the RRA slews, real-time\\ncommands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration.\\n\\n9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change\\n(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 17 DN\\n(3.9 volts).  The DC measurement reads 134 DN (15.7 volts).  These\\nmeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special\\nanomaly team.\\n\\n10. The Spacecraft status as of April 29, 1993, is as follows:\\n\\n       a)  System Power Margin -  75 watts\\n       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin\\n       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner\\n       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 23 degrees\\n           off-sun (lagging) and 4 degrees off-earth (leading)\\n       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1\\n       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range\\n       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,\\n           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS\\n       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours\\n           Time To Initiation - 203 hours\\n\\n\\nGDS (Ground Data Systems):\\n\\n1.  The first Galileo-GDS test of the MGDS V18.0 Command System (CMD) took\\nplace April 27, 1993 with DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna).  The test went\\nwell and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new DSN\\n(Deep Space Network) Group 5 Command Processor Assembly (CPA).  The test was\\nsuccessful and the next test for V18.0 CMD is scheduled for May 1, 1993 with\\nDSS-15 (Goldstone 34 meter antenna).\\n\\n2.  The April System Engineers Monthly Report(SEMR)/Ground System Development\\nOffice (GSDO) MMR was conducted Thursday, April 29.   A review of current\\nProject and Institutional (DSN and MOSO) system status was conducted.  On-going\\ncruise development plus the GSDO Phase 1 and 2 delivery schedules, past months\\naccomplishments  and potential problem areas were discussed.  No significant\\nschedule changes or significant problems were reported.\\n\\n\\nTRAJECTORY\\n\\n     As of noon Thursday, April 29, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory\\nstatus was as follows:\\n\\n\\tDistance from Earth         187,745,300 km (1.26 AU)\\n\\tDistance from Sun           296,335,800 km (1.98 AU)\\n\\tHeliocentric Speed          89,100 km per hour\\n\\tDistance from Jupiter       522,015,800 km\\n\\tRound Trip Light Time       20 minutes, 58 seconds\\n\\nSPECIAL TOPIC\\n\\n1.  As of April 29, 1993, a total of 70259 real-time commands have been\\ntransmitted to Galileo since Launch.  Of these, 65150  were initiated in the\\nsequence design process and 5109 initiated in the real-time command process.\\nIn the past week, 74 real time commands were transmitted: 73 were initiated\\nin the sequence design process and one initiated in the real time command\\nprocess.  Major command activities included commands to perform the initial\\nRRA slew test, uplink the RRA slew test mini-sequence, DACs to reposition the\\nstator and turn the TWNC on, reset the command loss timer, and execute the\\nRRA slew test.\\n     ___    _____     ___\\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\\\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\\n    | | | |  __ \\\\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\\n',\n",

Many different observations, including IRAS\\n> and COBE, have determined that interstellar dust grain temperatures\\n> can range from 40K to 150K.\\n\\nInterstellar grains are not at all close to blackbodies.  The \"large\"\\ngrains have sizes of order 0.1 micron and absorb visible light with\\nfair efficiency.  However, at temperatures below 100 K, 90% of the\\nthermal emission will be beyond 22 microns, where radiating\\nefficiency is poor.  (A small antenna cannot easily radiate at long\\nwavelengths.)  Thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate\\nthe energy they have absorbed.\\n\\nMoreover, the IRAS observations had a maximum wavelength of 100\\nmicrons.  Grains colder than 30 K will radiate primarily at longer\\nwavelengths, and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to them.  In\\nthe extreme limit, grains as cold as 5 K will be almost undetectable\\nby any conceivable observation.\\n\\nWorse still, IRAS color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a\\npopulation of \"small\" grains.  These grains have only perhaps 50\\natoms, and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to\\ntemperatures of several hundred or 1000 K.  Of course they cool\\nquickly and then stay cold for a while, but _when they are radiating_\\nthe characteristic temperature is several hundred K.  Even a small\\npopulation of these grains can dramatically raise the observed\\n\"average\" temperature.\\n\\nA model for local infrared emission consistent with COBE data has\\nthree components.  These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacal\\ndust (color temperature 5500 K), thermal emission from Zodiacal dust\\n(Tc = 280 K), and thermal emission from Galactic dust (Tc=25 K).  At\\nthe ecliptic poles, the emissivities or dilution factors are\\nrespectively 1.9E-13, 4E-8, and 2E-5.  The first two are roughly\\ndoubled in the ecliptic plane.\\n\\nTo find the thermal equilibrium temperature, we add up the dilution\\nfactor times the fourth power of temperature for all components, then\\ntake the fourth root.  In the table below, starlight comes from\\nAllen\\'s number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent\\nto 460 zero mag stars with B-V color of 0.75.  No doubt careful work\\ncould do much better.  (The person who suggested starlight had a\\ndilution factor of E-4 must have been remembering wrong.  We would be\\ncooked if that were the case.

I have had\\n>a quick look in the computer graphics literature with no results.\\n>Perhaps someone who has access to medical information could help?\\n \\nCertainly. Reference follows. \\n\\nBear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be called\\nred/green colour blind. One, protanopia, is caused by a lack or major\\ndysfunction of the L cones, those that respond best to long\\nwavelengths. This gives much reduced red/green and red/violet discrimination and\\nalso means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision.\\n\\nThe other, deuteranopia, is due to missing or dysfunctional M cones although it\\ncan also be caused by a lack of the L-M cone difference signals in the retina.\\nIt also gives reduced red/green discrimination but red/violet is unaffected. \\nUnlike protanopia, reds are not dimmer than  normal.\\n\\nOn a uniform chromaticity diagram - the horseshoe shaped one you see in computer\\ngraphics books - there is a single confusion point for each type of colour\\ndeficiency. Colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from this\\npoint. For protanopia the point is at u'=0.61,v'=0.51, very close to the far red\\ncorner. For deuteranopia, the point is at u'=-4.75, v'=1.31\\n\\nNote that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightly\\ndifferent values for these depending on the precise details of the experimental\\nsetup, random errors, and so on. The values quoted are typical.\\n\\nSo if all colours on a line are seen as the same, which colour is actually seen?\\n\\nThis problem has now been solved. Tests on people with one normal eye and one\\naffected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder onto\\nwhich all the colours collapse. For protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm on\\nthe spectral locus (the edge of the horseshoe); for deuteranopes the line is\\nvery similar,  joining 477nm and 579nm.\\n\\n*So* to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia or\\nduuteranopia:\\n\\n1) Plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram\\n2) Construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point\\n3) Find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line\\n4) This is the new chromaticity. \\n\\nThe best reference for this is Meyer, G.W. & Greenberg, D.P. (1988) 'Colour\\ndefective vision and computer graphics displays', IEEE Computer Graphics and\\nApplications 8(5) 28-40.\\n\\nYou will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are not\\nfamiliar with the CIE XYZ colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram.\\n\\n>I would like to write a program (probably a PPM filter) to allow\\n>previewing of images to check for sufficient contract for colour\\n>blind users. Not being colour blind myself, this is a bit difficult!\\n\\nYes this is certainly possible. You will need the chromaticities of the red\\ngreen and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on, and\\nthe chromaticity of the white point. This information can be measured, or\\nobtained from the manufacturer. I posted a list of some monitor chromaticities a\\ncouple of weeks ago.\\n\\nThe procedure, for each pixel (!) is as follows. (Some lookup tables might be a\\nhelp here.)\\n\\nA) convert RGB to CIE XYZ. This is a simple 3*3 matrix multiplication once you\\nhave the monitor data.\\nB) retaining the Y component for later, convert XYZ to chromaticity coordinates u'v'\\nusing u' = 4X/(X+15Y+3Z), v' = 9Y/(X+15Y+3Z)\\nC) find the equation of the line as in step 2 above\\nD) find the intersection as in step 3\\nE) convert back from u'v' to XYZ, using the Y value from step A\\nF) Ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor; if not, move it\\nalong a line in XYZ space towards neutral grey (ie half way between black and\\nwhite) until it is displayable.\\n\\n>Please email replies - I will summarise and repost if there is\\n>sufficient interest\\n\\nDone; also posted for the rest of us.\\n\\n--\\nChris Lilley\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nTechnical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project\\nComputer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, \\nManchester, UK.

Today, most people would have to go 100 miles\\n   or more. If we ever get to the point where we have billboards\\n   on orbit, that essentially means that no place on Earth is still\\n   \"wild.\" While that may or may not be a good thing, the orbital\\n   billboards aren\\'t the problem: They are just a symptom of \\n   growing, densely-populated civilization. Banning such ads will\\n   not save your view of the night sky, because by the time \\n   such ads could become widespread you will probably have trouble\\n   finding a place without street lights, where you can _see_\\n   the stars...\\n\\nThe rest of your post is strange mishmash of \"its already really bad\"\\nand \"it doesn\\'t really matter if it gets worse.\"  You should try to\\nfigure out what you are really arguing for.

I\\'m not\\n  sure exactly what they are.\\n  You can ftp the idraw\\'s binary from interviews.stanford.edu.\\n\\nc. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)\\n  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats\\n  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert\\n  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.\\n  Tgif\\'s sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu\\n  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)\\n\\nd. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).\\n  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all\\n  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.\\n\\ne. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output\\n  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.\\n\\nf. \\'ice\\' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It\\'s a PostScript-based\\n  graphical editor,and it\\'s available for anonymous ftp from Internet host\\n  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12).

Those are the general\\n  purpose packages I\\'ve heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I\\'m not sure how general purpose\\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I\\'ve\\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.

Its\\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\\n  Excel on the Mac if it\\'s not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\\n  that combination couldn\\'t handle, and the speed and ease of use\\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it\\'s mostly astronomical\\n  image processing which I\\'ve been doing. This means image enhancement,\\n  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image\\n  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\\n  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\\n  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \"\\n\\n[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and\\n for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)\\n===================================================\\n\\nGRASS\\n-----\\n  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army\\n  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and\\n  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a\\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\\n  capabilities.\\n\\n  Feature Descriptions\\n\\n  I use GRASS  because it\\'s public domain and can be obtained through the\\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of\\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them\\n  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh\\n  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for\\n  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  CERL\\'s Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\\n\\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  This location will be the new \"canonical\" source for GRASS software, as\\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\\n  \"tar\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John\\n  Parks\\' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,\\n  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review\\n  it and mail him comments/corrections.

Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\\n\\n  Feature Description\\n\\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.\\n  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering\\n  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,\\n  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\\n\\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\\n  for GIS applications.\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\\n\\nPCI\\n---\\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"\\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\\n\\n  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of\\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI\\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package is a set of utility\\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\\n  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and\\n  God only knows what all else -- there\\'s a LOT.  I don\\'t have and don\\'t\\n  use these, so can\\'t say much about them; you only buy the packages your\\n  particular application/interest calls for.\\n\\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default\\n  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There\\'s\\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\\n\\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\\n  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\\n  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\\n  graphic-arts industry\\'s \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven\\'t tried)\\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\\n  YOU\\'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\\n  over.  It\\'s worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to\\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\\n  can go into the PCI \"database\").\\n\\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\\n  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn\\'t suffice\\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It\\'s\\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\\n  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\\n  areas.\\n\\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\\n--------------------------------\\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\\n\\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\\n\\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you\\'re interested.  PCW requires X\\n  for display.\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\\n\\nCLRview\\n-------\\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\\n\\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.

During the frst second of the burst, and the last 4 seconds,\\nits flux is half of the peak flux.  It's flux is the peak flux the rest of the\\ntime.  Assume that the background flux is 10E-7 erg cm^-2 sec^-1.\\n        Then we had to find the integrated luminosity of the burst, for several\\ndifferent spheres: R=.25pc(Oort Cloud Radius), R=22.5pc(at the edge of the\\ngalaxy), R=183.5pc or the edge of the galactic corona, and lastly at a\\nR=8800Mpc.  \\n        We integrated the flux over all time to find the fluence, then used the\\nold standby formula:\\n                        Luminosity=4(pi)(r^2)Fpeak\\n        For a radius of .25 pc, we found an L around 10^32 erg/sec.  Pretty\\nenergetic for close by.  for the coronal model, we found around 10^43 erg/sec.\\nAnd lastly, for the cosmological model an L=10^53. That's what you'd call\\nmoderately energetic, I'd say.  Any suggestions about what could put out that\\nmuch energy in one second? \\n                                                -jeremy\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Big difference.\\n   That\\'s ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution\\n   to the Oort distribution when the Oort distribution is not well\\n   known - in particular comet aphelia (which are not well known)\\n   are not a good measure of the Oort cloud distribution...\\n\\nMerging neutron stars is at least a mechanism with about the right\\nenergy, except it doesn\\'t explain why there is no apparent correlation\\nwith galaxies or galaxy structure, there is no mechanism for getting\\nall the energy out in gamma rays (with any significant amount of\\nbaryons around there will be a lot of pair production, which makes a\\nplasma, which thermalizes the energy), it has trouble generating\\nenough energy to explain the most powerful bursts (10^52-53 ergs), it\\nhappens too fast compared to the burst duration, and it is hard to\\nmake tight-binaries of neutron stars.\\n\\nAnother cosmological mechinism is the catalytic conversion of a\\nneutron star to a strange star or the merger of two strange stars, but\\nthat uses pretty far-out physics.\\n\\nMy point is that we don\\'t have a good mechanism at any distance, so\\nGRB\\'s are likely to be happening by an unknown mechanism, so we can\\'t\\nrule out the Oort cloud.  What would be the spectrum of an event which\\nconverts a comet to strange matter?  The spectra for primordial black\\nholes eating comets and antimatter comets colliding with matter comets\\naren\\'t quite right, but perhaps there is an unusual mechanism which\\nmodifies the spectrum.  The energy matches very well for both of these\\nmechanisms.  According to Trevor Weeks, if the \"Tunguska Meteorite\"\\nwas a mini-black hole collision with the earth, then there are likely\\nto be enough mini-black holes around that the rate for BH-comet\\ncollisions matches the GRB rate well.\\n\\nThe fact that we don\\'t know the distribution of comets in the Oort\\ncloud isn\\'t a reason to rule them out; it makes it harder to rule them\\nout.  The point of the cited paper was that if we assume they got the\\nright distribution for the Oort cloud, it is hard but not impossible\\nto match that up with the distribution of GRB\\'s.  If they got the\\nwrong distribution for the Oort cloud, they can\\'t constrain any Oort-\\ncloud GRB\\'s at all.\\n\\nExecutive summary: we don\\'t know enough to rule out out the Oort\\ncloud.\\n',\n",

       "  'From: gorgen@ann-arbor.applicon.slb.com (David Gorgen)\\nSubject: Need help: Z-buffering lines & areas together\\nOrganization: Applicon, Inc.; Ann Arbor, MI (USA)\\nKeywords: Z-buffer, roundoff, lines, areas\\nLines: 84\\n\\nI\\'m asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low\\napparent precision in Z-buffering, that I\\'ve encountered in 2 different\\nPEX implementations.  I can\\'t find any discussion of this problem in any\\nresources I can lay hands on (e.g. the comp.windows.x.pex FAQ, Gaskins\\'s\\n_PEXlib_Programming_Manual_, vendors\\' documentation).\\n\\nI\\'m posting this article by itself on comp.graphics, and virtually the\\nsame article with a test program demonstrating the problem on\\ncomp.windows.x.pex.  The problem is hard to describe without pictures,\\nhence this article is longish.  If you can run PEXlib 5.x programs and\\nare interested, I encourage you to build and run the test program in\\ncomp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach\\nto dealing with it.  (It depends on the utility code from the above\\nGaskins book; instructions for fetching it via anonymous FTP are given.)\\n\\nThe problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize \"stitching\"\\nartifacts resulting from the use of Z-buffering with polylines that are\\ncoplanar with filled areas.  The interpolated Z values along a line will\\ndiffer slightly, due to roundoff error, from the interpolated Z values\\nacross an area, even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with\\nvertices of the area.  Because of this, it\\'s a tossup whether the\\nZ-buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed.\\nVisually, the result tends to be a dashed-line effect even though the\\nline is supposed to be solid.\\n\\nUsing the PEXlib API, my approach to a solution is to use two slightly\\ndifferent PEX view mapping transforms, in two view table entries, one\\nfor the areas and one for the lines.  The PEX structures or immediate-\\nmode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in\\neffect for areas, and the other is always in effect for lines.  The\\nresult is a slight shift in NPC Z coordinates for the lines, so as to\\nattempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines.\\n\\nThis shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used\\nin the PEXlib view table entry for lines just a hair \"backwards\" (i.e.\\nsmaller VRC Z coordinates), compared to their positions in the view\\ntable entry used for areas.  This means that when a point is transformed\\nto NPC, its Z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than\\nif it comes from an area, thus accomplishing the desired bias.\\n\\nI would expect the Z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount\\nto a few units at most, out of the entire dynamic range of the Z-buffer,\\ntypically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 (i.e. 16 or 24 bit Z-buffers).\\nTherefore, it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of Z in VRC\\nbetween the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix\\nthe stitching.\\n\\nBut in fact, experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003\\nto 0.006 of the range.  (Empirically, it\\'s worst when the NPC Z\\ncomponent of the slope of the surface is high, i.e. when it appears more\\nor less edge-on to the viewer.)  It\\'s as if only 8 or 9 bits of the\\nZ-buffer have any dependable meaning!  This amount is so great that one\\nproblem is replaced by another: sometimes the polylines \"show through\"\\nareas which they are supposed to lie behind.\\n\\nI\\'ve observed the problem on both Hewlett-Packard and Digital\\nworkstation PEX servers, to approximately the same degree.  The test\\nprogram demonstrates the problem on an MIT PEXlib 5.x implementation;\\nthis version is known to compile and run on an HP-UX system with PEX\\n5.1.\\n\\nOpen questions:\\n    (1) Why does this happen?\\n        --  Am I configuring the PEX view table wrongly?\\n        --  Is there a systematic difference in Z interpolation for lines\\n            as opposed to areas (e.g. pixel centers versus corners) which\\n            could be corrected for?\\n        --  Are PEX implementors wantonly discarding Z precision in their\\n            interpolators?\\n        --  Something else?\\n    (2) What to do about it?\\n        --  Can I fix my use of the view table to allow better precision\\n            in Z-buffered HLHSR?\\n        --  Is there another approach I can take to remove the stitching\\n            artifacts?\\n        --  Am I just out of luck?\\n\\nAny help would be immensely appreciated!\\n\\n-- \\n===============================================================================\\nDave Gorgen                         Internet: gorgen@ann-arbor.applicon.slb.com\\nApplicon Inc.                                 gorgen@aaaca1.sinet.slb.com\\nAnn Arbor, Michigan (USA)               UUCP: ...!uunet!sharkey!applga!gorgen\\n',\n",

To see a light \\ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \\nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \\nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \\nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \\nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \\n\\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \\nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \\ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \\nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \\nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \\ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \\nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \\n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \\none weekend, \"getting away from it all\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \\nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \\nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \\nmiles to the east.  (Their \\'security light\\' didn\\'t help matters \\nmuch either.)  But I\\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \\nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \\n\\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\\'t \\nfouled in some way.  (I mean they\\'ve been TRYING this forever - \\nlike, concerning Tesla\\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don\\'t watch \\ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \\ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \\nIf ya\\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \\nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \\n\\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \\nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \\n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \\nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I\\'ll be trying to see it \\nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \\nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \\nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that \\nas it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, \\neven if it can\\'t ever be perfectly achieved. \\n\\nRegards, \\nWm. Hathaway \\nBaltimore MD \\n\\n\\n(P.S. added Tuesday - this again is not a rights/vs./reality tome, \\njust a warning that someone into destroying beauty had better know \\nthat other people may not accept it without a complaint.)  \\n',\n",

Ed. 1993\\nPre-publication $84.50\\nISBN 0-89464-039-9\\n\\n\\nThis text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a\\ntechnological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the\\nspace betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the\\ntlatter half of theis century.  The need preceded the ability ot make\\nsuch a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realized\\nthat there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to\\nreach them.   \\n\\nTracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient,\\nattempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of\\ntechnology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  Once space travel\\nbecame feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed\\nthan ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that\\nmatter.  These also are described in theis book, for the same reason\\nas the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accurate\\nreflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, and\\nknowledge.  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as\\nwell as selected events important in developing the idea of\\nextraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  The chronological\\nentries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and\\nspeculative ventures.  They also allow comparisons between\\nsimultaneous events taking place in different countries.  They reveal\\nconnections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  Every\\nentry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  Nearly every\\nspacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  This\\nallows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize\\ndifferences, similarities, and influences.\\n\\nThis text will be of interest to students of astronautical history,\\nand also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic\\ndiagrams.   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and\\nhistorians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  The\\nunique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and\\nvery interesting history of the spaceship.\\n\\nSPECIAL FEATURES\\n\\nIncludes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and\\nfictional\\n\\nContains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photos\\ncontemporary with the subject.

[....]\\n\\nUnfortunately, the general public has a very narrow view of the deep, dark\\nrecesses of the art of computing.  What little they do see is from the view\\ngiven to them by the media.  From what I have seen from the media, \\'hacker\\'\\nis not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person.\\n\\nI, on the other hand, know what \\'hacker\\' means from those who consider\\nthemselves such.  Following is the definition from \"Jargon File 2.9.10\".\\n(This is also known as the \"Hackers Dictionary\".)  The definitions are\\narranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage:\\n\\n   :hacker: [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n.\\n     1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable\\n     systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most\\n     users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  2. One who\\n     programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys\\n     programming rather than just theorizing about programming.  3. A\\n     person capable of appreciating {hack value}.  4. A person who is\\n     good at programming quickly.  5. An expert at a particular program,\\n     or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in \\'a UNIX\\n     hacker\\'.  (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who\\n     fit them congregate.)  6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind.  One\\n     might be an astronomy hacker, for example.  7. One who enjoys the\\n     intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing\\n     limitations.  8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to\\n     discover sensitive information by poking around.  Hence \\'password\\n     hacker\\', \\'network hacker\\'.  See {cracker}.\\n\\n     The term \\'hacker\\' also tends to connote membership in the global\\n     community defined by the net (see {network, the} and\\n     {Internet address}).  It also implies that the person described\\n     is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic (see\\n     {hacker ethic, the}).\\n\\n     It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe\\n     oneself that way.  Hackers consider themselves something of an\\n     elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new\\n     members are gladly welcome.  There is thus a certain ego\\n     satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if\\n     you claim to be one and are not, you\\'ll quickly be labeled\\n     {bogus}).  See also {wannabee}.\\n\\n   :hacker ethic, the: n.  1. The belief that information-sharing\\n     is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of\\n     hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and\\n     facilitating access to information and to computing resources\\n     wherever possible.  2. The belief that system-cracking for fun\\n     and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits\\n     no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.\\n\\n     Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no\\n     means universally) accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe\\n     to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and\\n     giving away free software.  A few go further and assert that\\n     *all* information should be free and *any* proprietary\\n     control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the {GNU}\\n     project.\\n\\n     Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of\\n     cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering.\\n     But this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who\\n     see themselves as `benign\\' crackers (see also {samurai}).  On\\n     this view, it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy\\n     to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop,\\n     preferably by email from a {superuser} account, exactly how it\\n     was done and how the hole can be plugged --- acting as an\\n     unpaid (an unsolicited) {tiger team}.\\n\\n     The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker\\n     ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share\\n     technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing\\n     resources with other hackers.  Huge cooperative networks such as\\n     {USENET}, {Fidonet} and Internet (see {Internet address})\\n     can function without central control because of this trait; they\\n     both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be\\n     hackerdom\\'s most valuable intangible asset.\\n\\n:  Finally, a true hacker does not name himself/herself one, for this is\\n:  a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large.\\n: To me, a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who\\n: says \"Nahh, I just know a thing or two, people always exagerate...\" :-)\\n\\nNote that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing\\nlimself (meaning: himself/herself) one, but simply says that it is better\\nnot to do so.  There are many who do not know the meaning of \\'hacker\\'.  So,\\nin order to defend the true meaning of the word, it is sometimes necessary\\nto borrow on the reputation of a known (respected) hacker around the\\nworkplace.  (This means that \\'hacker\\' is defined in terms of some well-known\\nand respected person.)  Sometimes, there may only be one such person.\\n\\n: >No matter what Mr. Dumpty says, language doesn\\'t work that way.\\n:  Actually it does, you just have to get adequate press coverage... :-)\\n\\nLanguage works anyway that we want it to work.

(Looking at the elements for C1833 also shows the \\nlimitations of NORAD\\'s software -- but that\\'s another story.) \\n\\n    This probably has little relevance to space stations, since the 71 \\ndegree orbits of the C1603 satellites are at 850 km, which is \\nunacceptably far into the inner van Allen belt for manned platforms. But \\nit\\'s kind of interesting from the point of view of the physics of the \\nsituation. \\n\\n    (Orbital elements for these satellites are available on request.) \\n\\n\\nAllen Thomson                  SAIC                       McLean, VA\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nIs there an opinion here?

Aboard those boosters were a new breed of VENERA probe \\n    for the planet Venus. \\n\\n        Designated VENERA 15 and 16, the probes were meant not for landing\\n    yet more spherical craft on the Venerean surface but to radar map the\\n    planet in detail from orbit.  To accomplish this task, the basic\\n    VENERA design was modified in numerous areas.  The central bus core\\n    was made one meter (39.37 inches) longer to carry the two tons of\\n    propellant required for braking into orbit, double the fuel carried by\\n    the VENERA 9 and 10 orbiters eight years earlier.  Extra solar panels\\n    were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large\\n    amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging.  The\\n    dish-shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger \\n    to properly transmit this information to Earth. \\n\\n        Atop the buses, where landers were usually placed, were installed\\n    the 1.4 by 6-meter (4.62 by 19.8-foot), 300-kilogram (660-pound)\\n    POLYUS V side-looking radar antennae.  The radar system, possibly a\\n    terrain-imaging version of the nuclear-powered satellites used by \\n    the Soviets for Earth ocean surveillance, would be able to map Venus\\'\\n    surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers (0.62 to 1.2 miles). \\n\\n        The Soviet probes\\' imaging parameters were a vast improvement over\\n    the United States PIONEER VENUS Orbiter, which could reveal objects \\n    no smaller than 75 kilometers (45 miles) in diameter.  And while the\\n    VENERAs\\' resolution was comparable to that of similar observations \\n    made by the 300-meter (1,000-foot) Arecibo radio telescope on the \\n    island of Puerto Rico, the orbiters would be examining the northern\\n    pole of Venus.  This region was unobtainable by either Arecibo or \\n    PIONEER VENUS and appeared to contain a number of potentially \\n    interesting geological features worthy of investigation.\\n\\n        On October 10, 1983, after an interplanetary journey of 330 \\n    million kilometers (198 million miles) and two mid-course corrections, \\n    VENERA 15 fired its braking rockets over Venus to place itself in a \\n    polar orbit 1,000 by 65,000 kilometers (600 by 39,000 miles) around \\n    the planet, completing one revolution every twenty-four hours.  VENERA \\n    16 followed suit four days later.  The twin probes thus became Venus\\' \\n    first polar-circling spacecraft.\\n\\n        Radar operations began on October 16 for VENERA 15 and October 20 \\n    for VENERA 16.  For up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north\\n    pole, the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometers \\n    (ninety miles) wide and nine thousand kilometers (5,400 miles) long.  \\n    The craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over \\n    the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back \\n    to two large Soviet antennae on Earth.  Each strip of information took \\n    eight hours to process by computer.  By the end of their main missions \\n    in July of 1984, the VENERAs had mapped 115 million square kilometers \\n    (46 million square miles), thirty percent of the entire planet.\\n\\n        VENERA 15 and 16 revealed that Venus has a surface geology more\\n    complex than shown by PIONEER VENUS in the late 1970s.  Numerous hills, \\n    mountains, ridges, valleys, and plains spread across the landscape, \\n    many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the \\n    last one billion years.  In planetary terms this makes the Venerean \\n    surface rather young.  Hundreds of craters were detected as well, the \\n    largest of which had to have been created by meteorites (planetoids \\n    would be a better term here) at least fourteen kilometers (8.4 miles) \\n    across, due to Venus\\' very dense atmosphere.\\n\\n        There were some disagreements between U.S. and Soviet scientists\\n    on the origins of certain surface features.  For example, the probes\\' \\n    owners declared that the 96-kilometer (57.6-mile) wide crater at the \\n    summit of 10,800-meter (35,640-foot) high Maxwell Montes, the tallest \\n    mountain on the planet, was the result of a meteorite impact.  American \\n    scientists, on the other hand, felt the crater was proof that Maxwell \\n    was a huge volcano sitting on the northern \"continent\" of Ishtar Terra.  \\n\\n        In any event, the U.S. decided to wait on making verdicts about\\n    Venus until the arrival of their own radar probe, scheduled for later\\n    in the decade.  Originally named the Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar\\n    (VOIR), its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig-\\n    nated the Venus Radar Mapper (VRM).  Eventually the machine would be \\n    called MAGELLAN, after the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan \\n    (circa 1480-1521).  This vehicle would map the entire planet in even \\n    finer detail than the VENERAs.  For the time, however, the Soviet \\n    probes maintained that distinction.\\n\\n        Radar imaging was not the only ability of the VENERAs.  Bolted\\n    next to the POLYUS V radar antenna were the Omega altimeter and the \\n    Fourier infrared spectrometer, the latter for measuring the world\\'s\\n    temperatures.  The majority of the areas covered registered about\\n    five hundred degrees Celsius (932 degrees Fahrenheit), but a few\\n    locations were two hundred degrees hotter, possibly indicating \\n    current volcanic activity.  The probes also found that the clouds \\n    over the poles were five to eight kilometers (three to 4.8 miles) \\n    lower than at the equator.  In contrast, the polar air above sixty \\n    kilometers (thirty-six miles) altitude was five to twenty degrees \\n    warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights.\\n\\n        When the main mapping mission ended in July of 1984, there were \\n    plans for at least one of the VENERAs to radar image the surface at \\n    more southernly latitudes.  Unfortunately this idea did not come to \\n    pass, as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude-control\\n    gas to perform the operation.  \\n\\n        VENERA 15 and 16 ceased transmission in March of 1985, leaving \\n    the Soviet Institute of Radiotechnology and Electronics with six \\n    hundred kilometers (360 miles) of radar data tape to sort into an \\n    atlas of twenty-seven maps of the northern hemisphere of Venus.\\n\\n        Venus by Balloon\\n\\n        For years the thick atmosphere of Venus had been a tempting \\n    target to scientists who wished to explore the planet\\'s mantle of \\n    air with balloon-borne instruments.  Professor Jacques Blamont of \\n    the French space agency Centre National d\\'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)\\n    had proposed such an idea as far back as 1967, only to have a joint \\n    French-Soviet balloon mission canceled in 1982.  Nevertheless, \\n    late in the year 1984, such dreams would eventually come true.\\n\\n        When two PROTON rockets were sent skyward on December 15 and 21, \\n    the Soviet Union provided Western observers with the first clear, full \\n    views of the booster which had been launching every Soviet Venus probe \\n    since 1975.  This was but one of many firsts for the complex mission.\\n\\n        The unmanned probes launched into space that December were named\\n    VEGA 1 and 2, a contraction of the words VENERA and GALLEI - Gallei\\n    being the Russian word for Halley.  Not only did the spacecraft \\n    have more than one mission to perform, they also had more than one \\n    celestial objective to explore, namely the comet Halley.  \\n\\n        This famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to \\n    the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 1910.\\n    Since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from\\n    the formation of the solar system five billion years ago, scientists \\n    around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such \\n    bodies which actually come close to Earth.  \\n\\n        Most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar \\n    system.  Some, like Halley, are perturbed by various forces and fall \\n    in towards the Sun, where they circle for millennia spewing out ice \\n    and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar \\n    encounter.\\n\\n        The Soviet Union, along with the European Space Agency (ESA) and\\n    Japan\\'s Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), did not\\n    wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a\\n    close examination of Halley.  The ESA would be using the cylindrical\\n    GIOTTO probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the \\n    comet, while Japan\\'s first deep space craft - SAKIGAKE (Pioneer) and \\n    SUISEI (Comet) - would view Halley from a much safer distance. \\n\\n        Scientists in the United States also desired to study the comet\\n    from the vantage of a space probe, at one time envisioning a vessel\\n    powered by solar sails or ion engines.  However, government budget\\n    cuts to NASA canceled the American efforts.  The U.S. would have to\\n    make do primarily with Earth-based observations and the sharing of \\n    data from other nations, though an instrument named the Dust Counter \\n    and Mass Analyzer (DUCMA), designed by Chicago University Professor \\n    John Simpson, was added on the Soviet mission in May of 1984.\\n\\n        The Soviets\\' answer to Halley were the VEGAs.  Instead of building\\n    an entirely new craft for the mission, the Soviets decided to modify\\n    their VENERA bus design to encounter the comet while performing an \\n    advanced Venus mission along the way.  As VEGA 1 and 2 reached Venus,\\n    the buses would drop off one lander/balloon each and use the mass of \\n    the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet Halley, much as the \\n    U.S. probe MARINER 10 used Venus to flyby Mercury eleven years earlier. \\n    The Soviet craft would then head on to Halley, helping to pinpoint the \\n    location of the comet\\'s erupting nucleus for the GIOTTO probe to dive \\n    in only 605 kilometers (363 miles) away in March of 1986.\\n\\n        As planned, the two VEGAs arrived at Venus in June of 1985.  VEGA\\n    1 released its payload first on the ninth day of the month, the lander\\n    making a two-day descent towards the planet.  The craft touched the\\n    upper atmosphere on the morning of June 11.  Sixty-one kilometers\\n    (36.6 miles) above the Venerean surface a small container was released\\n    by the lander, which produced a parachute at 55 kilometers (33 miles)\\n    altitude.  Thus the first balloon probe ever to explore Venus had\\n    successfully arrived. \\n\\n        One kilometer after the opening of the parachute, helium gas was\\n    pumped into the Teflon-coated plastic balloon, inflating it to a\\n    diameter of 3.54 meters (11.68 feet).  Dangling on a tether thirteen\\n    meters (42.9 feet) below was the instrument package, properly known as\\n    an aerostat.  The top part of the 6.9-kilogram (15.18-pound) aerostat\\n    consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment\\n    point to the balloon.  Beneath it was the transmitter, electronics,\\n    and instruments.  Connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for\\n    measuring cloud particles.  The aerostat was painted with a special\\n    white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which\\n    permeated the planet\\'s atmosphere. \\n\\n        The VEGA 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of Venus just\\n    north of the equator.  Scientists were concerned that the gas bag \\n    would burst in the heat of daylight, so they placed it in the darkened \\n    hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data.  \\n    This action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as \\n    well, effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions.  \\n    The author wonders, though, if they could have used floodlights similar \\n    to the ones attached to VENERA 9 and 10 in 1975, when Soviet scientists \\n    had thought the planet\\'s surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight \\n    due to the permanently thick cloud cover.\\n\\n        The first balloon transmitted for 46.5 hours right into the day\\n    hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed, covering 11,600\\n    kilometers (6,960 miles).  The threat of bursting in the day heat did\\n    not materialize.  The VEGA 1 balloon was stationed at a 54-kilometer\\n    (32.4-mile) altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers\\n    (thirty miles), for this was considered the most active of the three\\n    main cloud layers reported by PIONEER VENUS in 1978.  Indeed the\\n    balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to 250 kilometers\\n    (150 miles) per hour.  Strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and\\n    down two to three hundred meters (660 to 990 feet) through most of the\\n    journey.  The layer\\'s air temperature averaged forty degrees Celsius\\n    (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and pressure was a mere 0.5 Earth atmosphere.\\n    The nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds. \\n\\n        Early in the first balloon\\'s flight, the VEGA 1 lander was already\\n    headed towards the Venerean surface.  Both landers were equipped with\\n    a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on VENERA 13 \\n    and 14 in 1982.  However, VEGA 1 would become unable to report the\\n    composition of the ground at its landing site in Rusalka Planitia, the\\n    Mermaid Plain north of Aphrodite Terra.  While still ten to fifteen\\n    minutes away from landing, a timer malfunction caused the drill to \\n    accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers (9.6 \\n    miles) above the surface. \\n\\n        There was neither any way to shut off the instrument before\\n    touchdown nor reactivate it after landing.  This was unfortunate not\\n    only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of\\n    Venus was covered with such smooth low-level lava plains and had never \\n    before been directly examined.  Nevertheless, the surface temperature \\n    and pressure was calculated at 468 degrees Celsius (874.4 degrees \\n    Fahrenheit) and 95 Earth atmospheres respectively during the lander\\'s \\n    56 minutes of ground transmissions.  A large amount of background \\n    infrared radiation was also recorded at the site.\\n\\n        As had been done when the drills and cameras on VENERA 11 and \\n    12 had failed in December of 1978, the Soviets focused on the data\\n    returned during the lander\\'s plunge through the atmosphere.  The\\n    French-Soviet Malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur, chlorine, \\n    and possibly phosphorus.  It is the sulfur - possibly from active \\n    volcanoes - which gives the Venerean clouds their yellowish color.\\n    The Sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air\\n    between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometers (28.8 and 37.8 miles)\\n    contained one milligram (0.015 grain) of sulfuric acid.\\n\\n        The VEGA 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud decks \\n    appeared to be at odds with the information from PIONEER VENUS.\\n    The case was made even stronger by the fact that VEGA 2\\'s results\\n    nearly matched its twin.  The VEGAs found only two main cloud layers \\n    instead of the three reported by the U.S. probes.  The layers were \\n    three to five kilometers (1.8 to 3 miles) thick at altitudes of 50 \\n    and 58 kilometers (30 and 34.8 miles).  The clouds persisted like a\\n    thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometers (21 miles), \\n    much lower than the PV readings.  One possibility for the discrepan-\\n    cies may have been radical structural changes in the Venerean air \\n    over the last seven years.\\n\\n        When the lander and balloon finally went silent, the last \\n    functioning part of the VEGA 1 mission, the flyby bus, sailed on\\n    for a 708 million-kilometer (424.8 million-mile) journey around\\n    the Sun to become the first probe to meet comet Halley.  On March\\n    6, 1986, the bus made a 8,890-kilometer (5,334-mile) pass at the \\n    dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space.\\n    The Soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial\\n    bodies with one space vessel.\\n\\n        On June 13, VEGA 2 released its lander/balloon payload for\\n    a two-day fall towards Venus.  Like its duplicate, the VEGA 2\\n    balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking\\n    it on Earth for 46.5 hours before battery failure on the morning\\n    side of the planet.  During its 11,100-kilometer (6,660-mile)\\n    flight over Venus, the second balloon entered in a rather still\\n    environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission.\\n    After 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent \\n    for a further eight hours.  When the balloon passed over a five-\\n    kilometer (three-mile) mountain on the \"continent\" of Aphrodite \\n    Terra, a powerful downdraft pulled the craft 2.5 kilometers (1.5 \\n    miles) towards the surface.\\n\\n        Temperature sensors on the VEGA 2 balloon reported that the air \\n    layer it was moving through was consistently 6.5 degrees Celsius \\n    (43.7 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than the area explored by the VEGA 1\\n    balloon.  This was corroborated by the VEGA 2 lander as it passed \\n    through the balloon\\'s level.  No positive indications of lightning\\n    were made by either balloon, and the second aerostat\\'s nephelometer \\n    failed to function.\\n\\n        The VEGA 2 lander touched down on the northern edge of Aphrodite\\n    Terra\\'s western arm on the fifteenth of June, 1,500 kilometers (900\\n    miles) southeast of VEGA 1.  The lander\\'s resting place was smoother\\n    than thought, indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a\\n    relatively young one covered in fresh lava.  The soil drill was in\\n    working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite-troctolite, \\n    rare on Earth but present in Luna\\'s highlands.  This rock is rich in \\n    aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium.  A high degree \\n    of sulfur was also present in the soil.  The air around VEGA 2 measured \\n    463 degrees Celsius (865.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and 91 Earth atmospheres,\\n    essentially a typical day (or night) on Venus.\\n\\n        Far above the VEGA 2 lander, its carrier bus sped past Venus at\\n    a distance of 24,500 kilometers (14,700 miles) and followed its twin \\n    to comet Halley, making a closer flyby on March 9, 1986 at just 8,030 \\n    kilometers (4,818 miles).  Both probes helped to reveal that the comet \\n    is a very dark and irregular-shaped mass about fourteen kilometers \\n    (8.4 miles) across, rotating once every 53 hours, give or take three \\n    hours.\\n\\n        Since both VEGA craft were still functioning after their Halley\\n    encounters, Soviet scientists considered an option to send the \\n    probes to other celestial objects.  One prime target was the near-\\n    Earth planetoid 2101 Adonis, which VEGA 2 could pass at a distance \\n    of six million kilometers (3.6 million miles).  Sadly, the Soviets \\n    had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly \\n    a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was \\n    not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach Adonis as planned.  \\n    VEGA 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987.\\n\\n        Future Plans Diverted\\n\\n        The impressive VEGA mission had given some scientists numerous \\n    ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second \\n    world from the Sun.  One example was the VESTA mission, planned for\\n    the early 1990s.\\n\\n        This Soviet-French collaboration called for the launch of multiple \\n    probes on a single PROTON rocket in either 1991 or 1992.  The craft \\n    would first swing by Venus and drop off several landers and balloon \\n    probes.  The aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet\\'s \\n    corrosive atmosphere for up to one month, a large improvement over \\n    the VEGA balloons\\' two days.  The mission would then head out to \\n    investigate several planetoids and comets, including a possible \\n    landing on Vesta (thus the mission name), the most reflective Main \\n    Belt planetoid as seen from Earth.\\n\\n        Unfortunately for Venus exploration, plans began to change in\\n    the Soviet Union.  In 1986 the Soviets decided to reroute the VESTA\\n    mission to the red planet Mars instead of Venus, keeping the comet\\n    and planetoid aspects intact.  By this time in the Soviet space \\n    program interest was focusing on Mars.  Already under construction \\n    was an entirely new probe design called PHOBOS.  Two members of this \\n    class were planned to leave Earth in 1988 and orbit Mars the next \\n    year.  PHOBOS 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on\\n    Mars\\' largest moon, Phobos. \\n\\n        All this was a prelude to even more advanced Mars expeditions,\\n    including balloon probes, rovers, soil sample return craft, and \\n    eventually human explorers in the early Twenty-First Century.\\n    The environment of Venus was just too hostile for any serious\\n    consideration of human colonization in the near future.\\n\\n        But things began to look bleak for Soviet Venus and Mars\\n    exploration.  Both PHOBOS probes failed to complete their missions,\\n    one losing contact on the way to the Red Planet in 1988 and the other\\n    going silent in Mars orbit just one week before the planned moon\\n    landing in March of 1989. \\n\\n        In 1989 a plan was devised for a Venus orbiter to drop eight to\\n    ten penetrators around the planet in 1998.  Several years later the\\n    mission launch date was moved to the year 2005 and has now been put \\n    on indefinite hold.  No other official Soviet missions to Venus have\\n    since been put forth, a sad commentary after twenty-five years of\\n    continuous robotic exploration of the planet. \\n\\n        During the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change\\n    was taking over the Soviet Union.  President Mikhail Gorbachev began \\n    to \"open up\" his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with \\n    the rest of the nations, particularly those in the West.  While the \\n    culture became less oppressive than in the past, the economy was taking \\n    a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a \"free market\".\\n\\n        These effects hit everywhere, including the space program.\\n    Missions at all levels were cut back.  The Soviets began making\\n    almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space-faring\\n    nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to \\n    make money.  \\n\\n        In early 1992 it was reported that the Soviets were offering for \\n    sale several fully-equipped VENERAs they had in storage for the price \\n    of 1.6 million dollars each, an incredibly low price for any planetary \\n    probe.  No nation took them up on the bargain.  Meanwhile the United \\n    States was gearing up for new Venus missions of their own.\\n\\n        MAGELLAN and GALILEO \\n\\n        The U.S. reactivated their long-dormant planetary exploration\\n    with the launch of the Space Shuttle ATLANTIS on May 4, 1989.\\n    Aboard the Shuttle was the MAGELLAN spacecraft, a combination of\\n    spare parts from other U.S. probes designed to make the most \\n    detailed and complete radar-mapping of Venus in history.  When\\n    MAGELLAN reached the second world in August of 1990, it would be\\n    able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108\\n    meters (360 feet), surpassing the abilities of VENERA 15 and 16.\\n\\n        In the interim another American probe was launched from a Space \\n    Shuttle which would make a quick flyby of Venus on its way to orbit \\n    the giant planet Jupiter in 1995.  On October 18, 1989, the Shuttle \\n    ATLANTIS released its second unmanned planetary probe into space, \\n    named GALILEO after the famous Italian astronomer who discovered the \\n    probe\\'s primary target\\'s major moons in 1610.\\n\\n        In the absence of a powerful enough booster to send GALILEO on\\n    a direct flight to the Jovian planet, the probe was sent around\\n    Venus and Earth several times to build up enough speed to reach\\n    Jupiter.  As a result, Venus became GALILEO\\'s first planetary\\n    goal in February of 1990.  The probe radioed back images of the\\n    planet\\'s swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in\\n    that violent atmosphere.\\n\\n        On the Drawing Boards\\n\\n        With the incredible success of MAGELLAN in the last few years,\\n    new plans have been laid out for further journeys to Venus.  Scien-\\n    tists in the U.S. have talked to space scientists in the former Soviet \\n    Union - now the Commonwealth of Independent States since January 1, \\n    1992 - of a cooperative effort to launch new VENERA lander missions \\n    within in the next decade.  Japan, India, and the ESA have also\\n    considered their own Venus missions in the next few decades.\\n\\n        In February of 1993 NASA came up with several new Venus projects \\n    as part of their Discovery Program for launching inexpensive probes\\n    throughout the solar system.  For Venus two missions were selected\\n    for further study:  A Venus Multiprobe Mission involving the landing\\n    of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds, air\\n    temperature, and pressure; and the Venus Composition Probe, designed\\n    to study Venus\\' atmosphere while descending through the thick air\\n    with the aid of a parachute, much as the Soviets had done since 1967.\\n    Final project decisions will be made in 1994.\\n\\n        Humans on Venus      \\n\\n        Will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of Venus?\\n    At present the lead-melting temperatures and crushing air pressure\\n    would be threatening to any Earth life not protected in something\\n    even tougher than a VENERA lander.  Plans have been looked into\\n    changing the environment of Venus itself into something more like\\n    Earth\\'s.  However, it should be noted that any such undertaking\\n    will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide \\n    atmosphere, a major reduction in surface heat, and the ability \\n    to speed up the planet\\'s rotation rate to something a bit faster\\n    than once every 243 Earth days.  Such a project may take centuries\\n    if not millennia.\\n\\n        In the meantime efforts should be made to better understand\\n    Venus as its exists today.  We still have yet to fully know how\\n    a world so seemingly similar to Earth in many important ways became\\n    instead such a deadly place.  Will Earth ever suffer this fate?\\n    Perhaps Venus holds the answers.  Such answers may best be found\\n    through international cooperation, including the nation which \\n    made the first attempts to lift the cloudy veils from Venus.\\n\\n        Bibliography -\\n\\n         Barsukov, V.

I have a question regarding satellite technology seen\\nin the movie Patriot Games.  In the movies, the CIA utilizes its\\norbitting sats to pinpoint a specific terrorist camp in N Africa.\\nThe photos taken by the sats are stunning!  I know that sats are\\ncapable of photographing the license plates of vehicles.  My\\nquestion is this:  The camp in question was taken out by the\\nBritish SAS.  And while the SAS was in action, the CIA team was\\nwatching in the warroom back in Langley, VA.  The action of the SAS\\nwas clear and appeared to be relayed via a sat.  The action was at\\nnight and the photography appeared to be an x-ray type.  That is,\\none could see the action within the tents/structures of the camp.\\nDoes such techology exist and what is it's nature?  i.e., UV, IR,\\nx-ray, etc.\\n\\nPS  Who wrote the book Patriot Games?\\n\\nMad Vlad\\n\",\n",

Some wonder whether or not the moon could\\nhave ever supported an atmosphere.  I'd be interested in knowing what\\nour geology/environmental sciences friends think.\\n\\nAs for human tolerances, the best example of human endurance in terms\\nof altitude (i.e. low atmospheric pressure and lower oxygen partial pressure)\\nis in my opinion to the scaling of Mt. Everest without oxygen assistance.\\nThis was accomplished by a team of mountaineers who trained at high\\naltitudes for quite awhile (I think a few months) and then were flown by\\nhelicopter from that training altitude to the equivalent altitude on\\nMount Everest, where they began the ascent of our planet's highest peak\\nwithout oxygen tanks.  This is quite a feat of physiological endurance, because\\nif you or I tried to go to 20,000 feet and exert ourselves, we would probably\\npass out, get altitude sick, and could even die from cerebral edema. So\\nthis is the limit of low pressure.  High pressure situations would be\\nlimited by the duration of time which it takes to slowly acclimate to a higher\\npressure.  Skin divers would know alot about high pressure situations and\\ncould tell you about how they safely make deep dives without getting the\\nbends.  Some military experiments have put people under several atmospheres of\\npressure (not sure what the high limit was because the papers aren't in\\nfront of me).  Usually at a certain point, the nitrogen in the air becomes\\ntoxic to the body and you start acting idiotic.  Divers call this nitrogen\\nnarcosis.  Those afflicted can do very dangerous and irrational things, like\\ntaking off a diving mask and oxygen tank in order to talk to fish at 100 feet\\nunder water.  (Hope any diving folk can elaborate on this matter, as I\\nam not a diving expert).\\n\\nMars cannot support human life without pressurization because the atmosphere\\nis too thin (1/100 th  our Earth's atmospheric density).  In addition,\\nthe Mars atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide.  Basically, you would need a \\npressure suit there, or you'd die from the low pressure.

The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a\\n   version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).\\n   I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results\\n   (for better or for worse).\\n\\n   I pulled out a copy of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" that I had recorded off TV\\n   a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there\\'s a sequence where\\n   the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\\n   a portion of about 30 seconds\\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\\n   station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\\n   frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\\n   5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\\n\\n   I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\\n   card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\\n   imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\\n   keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\\n   to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\\n   \"2.00\" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\\n   frames.\\n\\n   I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \"Raw Speed Test\" program I used\\n   for the results I\\'d been reporting earlier.\\n\\n   Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\\n\\n   That\\'s right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\\n   test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\\n   disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\\n   was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk\\n   (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\\n\\n   I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\\n   scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\\n   size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who\\n   observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in\\n   action, not 1.5. I\\'d try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don\\'t think it\\'s\\n   entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...\\n\\n   Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\\n\\n   The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\\n   \"preferred\" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\\n   from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime\\'s normal synchronized playback).\\n   A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\\'t work too well: the playback was\\n   very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with\\n   ease. I can\\'t believe that QuickTime\\'s synchronization code would add this\\n   much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system\\'s task\\n   switching.\\n\\n   A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn\\'t see\\n   any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight\\n   stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.\\n\\n   I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the\\n   key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also\\n   improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance\\n   even more...\\n\\n   Lawrence D\\'Oliveiro                       fone: +64-7-856-2889\\n   Computer Services Dept                     fax: +64-7-838-4066\\n   University of Waikato            electric mail: ldo@waikato.ac.nz\\n   Hamilton, New Zealand    37^ 47\\' 26\" S, 175^ 19\\' 7\" E, GMT+12:00\\n\\n\\nI\\'m afraid I missed the start of this thread, but there are three factors that\\ncan significantly affect QuickTime\\'s playback speed that you may want to take\\ninto account:\\n\\n(1) playback bit depth (things are fastest when you play a\\nmovie back at the bit depth it was compressed for, this is usually 8 or 16\\nbit, but other depths are (of course) possible).\\n\\n(2) type of scaling (QT is optimized for \"double size\" scaling, other scaling\\nfactors hit peformance much harder).\\n\\n(3) playback window position (MoviePlayer limits your window placement choices\\nto advantagous pixel boundaries by default, I\\'m not sure about Premiere).\\n\\nAny combination of those can radically alter playback performance.  Image size\\nis, of course, another biggie.  Giving the movie player lots of RAM can also\\nmake a real difference.\\n\\nForgive me if these were mentioned earlier in the thread...\\n\\n-Peter Lee\\n\\n \\n--\\n/-------------------- Peter E.

At the time,I felt \\nthat\\nthe idea of a big \"mother ship\" had some merit - the Voyagers had to be rather\\nsmall, lightweight craft due to the limitations imposed by using weak Titan\\nIII/Centaur launchers.

The \"bus\" could have included far more powerful\\ncameras/telescopes/scientific equipment and a heavier/more powerful power\\nsource than the Voyagers as there would be no limitations on weight anymore.\\nExtremely important as the Voyagers had to perform most of their measurements\\nwithin a couple of weeks before and after planetary encounter, and usually at a\\nrelatively great distance.\\n---\\nThe smaller probes carried aboard might have been based on the \"real\" Voyagers,\\nand an even smaller version like the one scheduled for launch towards Pluto in\\nthe early 21st century, and would have been released at various points during\\nthe mission. The advantages are obvious: the bus would have carried out the\\nsame basic Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus-Neptune mission than Voyager 2 did, but in\\naddition two \"sub-probes\" could have been relased at Saturn, examining\\nthat planet\\'s south polar regions before moving on to Pluto. This would have\\nenabled NASA to map both hemispheres of Pluto/Charon by 1986...and several\\nother probes could have examined parts of the Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptune\\nsystems that weren\\'t examined in great detail by the Voyagers due to\\ntrajectory-related factors. A small \"swarm\" of camera-equipped miniature space\\nprobes released a month before encounter would have been too costly for a \\nsmall Voyager-type mission but entirely feasible if launched from a heavy, \\nwell-equipped spacecraft.

It\\'s creating its own market for\\nsmall payloads.)\\n\\nI read the magazines and I\\'ve attended the last two IAFs.

WHere are they.\\nOriginator: news@nimaster\\nNntp-Posting-Host: astro.princeton.edu\\nOrganization: Princeton University\\nLines: 51\\n\\n\\nI feel compelled to complain: the statement that recent observations\\nrule out merging neutron stars as sources of gamma-ray bursts is\\nutterly false, even though it is popular enough to make it to\\nBATSE press releases.\\nThe idea behind the statement is as follows: \\n     \"if you smack two neutron\\n      stars together, or have a neutron star be gobbled up by a black hole,\\n      a lot of energy is released, enough for a gamma-ray burst at a\\n      cosmological distance. But, so the reasoning continues, this energy \\n      is released below a lot of matter, so the radiation becomes\\n      thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum.\\n      The observed spectra are strongly non-thermal, so this model must\\n      be wrong.\"\\nAs so often, the fault lies with the imagination of the person who\\nwas trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model. It\\nmay be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-ray\\nburst, but the \\'fireball\\' of energy and matter that is created\\nmay spew out a relativistic flow. When this slams into the surrounding \\nmedium, a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results, which may\\ncarry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy. All\\nthis is not my idea: it is in a series of papers by Martin Rees,\\nPeter Meszaros (sorry for the missing accents:-) and co-workers.\\nIt is certainly not a complete model, but it may well be the best one\\naround (summing over all proposed distance scales). An alternative\\nproposal for what creates the initial fireball, by the way, is the \\nso-called \\'failed supernovae\\' scenario by Stan Woosley, in which\\na very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black\\nhole. If the stellar core was rotating, part of the infalling matter\\nwill be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal\\nforce, and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the\\nblack hole. This beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis,\\nwhich again constitutes relativistic flow. The rate of such\\nevents may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers,\\nbut the flux may be more strongly beamed, so that the net rate\\nof bursts observed on Earth stays the same between the two\\nscenarios, but the energy released per event can be a lot less\\nin the failed supernova scenario.\\n\\nOn another note: I do believe that the distance scale must \\nultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method\\nsuch as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths,\\nor finding a definitive signature of some known class of\\nobjects in the distribution of positions and fluxes.

At this point,  many\\ncongresspersons have been approached about the bill. However,\\nfor a successful effort to pass the bill, we need the best\\npossible congressperson to introduce the bill. Due to his\\nposition as Chair of the House Committee on Space and Science,\\nCongressman George Brown is the logical choice. He has a long\\nrecord of support and interest in space development, and helped\\npass the Launch Services Purchase Act and the Space Settlements\\nAct.                      \\n        There is a small group of activists in southern California \\nwho have assisted George Brown in his recent re-election campaigns.\\nWe are mobilizing this group to have them tell Congressman Brown\\nabout the Back to the Moon bill. We are also asking pro-space\\nconstituents to let him know that they care about getting\\nAmerica back to the Moon.\\n        Finally, there is a good chance that a nationwide alert \\nfor space activists to call or write George Brown to have him\\nintroduce the Back to the Moon bill may be staged during late\\nspring, 1993.\\n        All this should produce a positive reaction from Brown's\\noffice. As more is known, it will be passed on.\\n        However, even if we are successful in getting him to support\\nthe bill,  this alone will not ensure passage of the bill. For\\nany bill to become law, one of three conditions must exist:\\neither the bill must reflect widespread national support for an\\nissue (such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits); be\\npropelled by high-priced lobbyists (we're out of luck there); or\\nhave widespread support within Congress, due to small, but\\nwidespread, constituent support. The latter is the path that we,\\nby necessity, must choose.                    \\n        This means that the introduction of the Lunar Resources \\nData Purchase Act must be immediately accompanied by a large number\\nof congresspersons' sponsorship of the bill.  To accomplish\\nthis, we need activists to ask their congressperson to support\\nthe Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act - now. To wait until the\\nbill is introduced is simply too late - it takes time to have a\\ncongressperson's staff review a bill.\\n        If your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yet\\nintroduced, please elicit their opinion of the bill as currently\\nwritten. We appreciate all comments on the bill from activists\\nand politicians.\\n        If you have yet to see the Back to the Moon bill, please\\nrequest a copy by Email (please include your U.S. postal service\\naddress), or contact your local chapter of the National Space\\nSociety).\\n\\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\\n\",\n",

Perhaps by a collision with a smaller,\\nalready-existing Neptunian moon, perhaps by a very close passage through\\nNeptune\\'s atmosphere - mondo aerobraking!].\\n\\n  He notes that the two recently discovered \"Kuiper Belt\" objects,\\n1992 QB1 and 1993 FW, plus Chiron and Pholus, are all about the same \\nmass, and he identifies this group as one-accretion-down from the\\nlarger bodies of Triton and Pluto/Charon.  Pluto/Charon, he thinks,\\nformed when an impacting body hit proto-Pluto, knocking some material\\ninto a ring around Pluto which later accreted in Charon; similar to\\nideas about the formation of Earth\\'s moon.  There is good evidence\\nfrom spectra that the surfaces of Pluto and Charon are very different\\n(Pluto has methane frost, Charon doesn\\'t), which can be used as evidence\\nfor the impact theory.\\n\\n  He believes that there may be around 1000 Pluto-to-Chiron-sized objects\\nremaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside Neptune\\'s \\norbit, beyond 35 AU or so.  1992 QB1 and 1993 FW are the first members\\nof this population to be found, in his model.  Note that such bodies\\nwill be very dark, since if their surfaces are covered with methane \\nfrost, it will have photolyzed into very dark, long-chain hydrocarbons\\nby now.  The reason that Pluto has such a high albedo (around 0.5, I think)\\nis that its surface warms up JUST enough around perihelion to sublimate,\\nand when the atmosphere freezes out again, thirty years later, it forms\\nbright, new frost.  So any bodies much farther away than 30 AU are going\\nto be very hard to see.\\n\\n  I hope I haven\\'t made any errors in the transcription; if you see\\na howling mistake, it\\'s undoubtedly mine, not his.\\n\\n  By the way, he\\'s one of the top guns behind the Pluto Fast Flyby\\nmission (I think), and said that the current plans are to use a\\nTitan 4 to send the probe on \"just about a rectilinear trajectory\"\\nto Pluto (we were speaking loosely at the time...).  He\\'d like\\nto use a Proton, which gives a slightly smaller velocity but costs\\nMUCH less.  His figures: $500 Million for 2 Titan 4 launches (there\\nwill be two separate probes, launched separately), or $120 Million\\nfor 2 Proton launches.  He told a story about how the Soviets originally\\noffered to sell Proton launches for $30 Million each, but were forced\\nto increase their prices in the US in order to be allowed in the\\nmarketplace.\\n\\n  I\\'m just telling you what he said.\\n\\n                          Michael\\n\\n-- \\n-----                                                    Michael Richmond\\n\"This is the heart that broke my finger.\"    richmond@astro.princeton.edu\\n\\n',\n",

I am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere\\n> evolve given a range of physical aspects of the planet.  The question\\n> is what physical aspects simply disallow earth like conditions.\\n\\nThis is a good question.  There are major blind spots in our understanding\\nof what makes the earth habitable.  For example, why does the earth\\'s\\natmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does?  The naive\\nanswer is \"photosynthesis\", but this is clearly incomplete.  Photosynthesis\\nby itself can\\'t make the atmosphere oxygenated, as the oxygen produced\\nis consumed when the plants decay or are eaten.  What is needed\\nis photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of\\nthe resulting reduced material.\\n\\nOn earth, this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic\\nmatter, mostly from oceanic sources.  However, this burial requires\\ncontinental sediments (in the deep ocean, the burial rate is so slow\\nthat most material is consumed before it can be sequestered).\\n\\nThis suggests that a planet without large oceans, or a planet without\\ncontinents undergoing weathering, will have a hard time accumulating\\nan oxygen atmosphere.  In particular, an all-ocean planet may have a\\nhard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere.\\n\\nThere is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth\\'s atmosphere\\nhas been relatively stable over geological time, for a period at least\\n2 orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric O2 to\\nweathering in the absence of replenishment.  No convincing feedback\\nmechanism has been identified.  Perhaps the reason is the weak\\nanthropic principle: if during the last 500 MYr or so, the oxygen\\nlevel had dropped too low, we wouldn\\'t be here to be wondering about\\nit.\\n\\n\\tPaul F.

As far as commercialization, that is\\n>a long ways off.  ...\\n> Anybody know anything further? Is this really news? Does this\\n>threaten further work on DC-? ?\\n  \\n   Boeing has been looking at several TSTO vehicles and has carried\\nout extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for some\\ntime.  A good reference on this might be: \"Comparison of Propulsion\\nOptions for Advanced Earth-To-Orbit (ETO) Applications (IAF-92-\\n0639).\" by V.A. Weldon and L.E. Fink from Boeing.   The paper\\ndescribes a propane-fueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieve\\naircraft-like operational efficiencies without the problems\\nassociated with liquid hydrogen fuel.  Basically, it\\'s a high-speed\\nairplane launching a Hermes-type spaceplane\\n   The design (the concept is also called \"Beta\") as laid out in the\\npaper can launch at least 10,000 pounds into polar orbit, or 20,000\\npounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and\\nlife support.  System design reliability is .9995.\\n   Beta is a 360-foot-long first stage powered by two large ramjets\\nand 12 high- speed civil transport (HSCT) turbofans.  A 108-foot-\\nlong reusable orbiter is trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first-\\nstage aircraft, which also could accommodate a longer and heavy\\npayload on an expendable second stage.\\n   To launch the orbital vehicle, the first stage takes off like a\\nnormal HSCT and accelerates to Mach 3.  At that point the turbofans,\\nmodified to burn catalyzed JP-7, would shut off and the ramjets,\\nwould take over.  At Mach 5.5 the orbiter or the ELV would swing\\nout, ignite and proceed to orbit. Both vehicles would land like\\naircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions.\\n   Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff\\nis about 1.5 M lbs, roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An-225.\\nThe orbiter stages weighs about 400,Klbs including 335 Klbs\\nof LOX and subcooled propane to power two 250 Klbs vacuum thrust\\nrocket engines. Propellants would be stored at 91 degrees Kelvin,\\nwith the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15-by-\\n25-foot cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station. LOX would\\nbe stored aft.  Weldon and Fink claim the key to this design\\'s\\nsuccess is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact\\ntankage allowed by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel.\\n     The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design.  They conclude\\nwhile a SSTO has a slightly lower recurring cost, a TSTO is easier,\\ncheaper, and less risky to develop, simpler to build, has greater\\nsafety and mission versatility and doesn\\'t carry the hard-to-handle\\nand bulky hydrogen fuel. The conlcude \"In conjunction with its major\\nuse of airplane type engines and fuel, as well as its inherent self-\\nferry capability, it is probably the system most likely to provide\\nas close to airline-like operations as possible with a practical\\nconfiguration, until a single stage airbreather/rocket concept can\\nbe shown to be operationally viable.\"\\n  \\n>Is this really news? Does this threaten further work on DC-?\\n   Weldon and others at Boeing have been working on TSTO designs for\\nsome time.  I expect this, or a similar concept (perhaps the HTHL\\nSSTO they proposed for the SDIO SSTO first phase) is being re-\\nexamined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of SpaceLifter.\\n   Does it threaten DC-???.  Possibly -- There is a set of on-going\\nstudies trying straighten out the government\\'s future space\\ntransportation strategy.  MDC and Boeing (as well as other firms)\\nare providing data to a joint study team back in DC.  There are\\nvarious factions and options vying for attention -- including\\nshuttle upgrades, shuttle replacement (what was called the \"4-2-3\"\\narchitecture), SpaceLifter, ELV upgrades, and various advanced\\nvehicles (ALES, Beta, DC-??, NASP, FSTS, SSTOs of several types,\\netc.)  NASA/DOD/DOT are trying to put together a coherent strategy\\nfor future US gov\\'t space transportation systems, and trying to\\njuggle near-term launch needs (like for DoD and NASA) against\\nmedium-term needs (including commercial considerations), and against\\nthe investment and risk of going to \"leap frog\" new technologies\\nlike SDIO/SSTO and NASP and Beta.\\n   It\\'s a heck of a problem.  The worst part of the problem isn\\'t\\nthat there aren\\'t promising ideas and concepts -- there are dozens\\nof them -- but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs in\\nthe near term.

Larson, 1984, North \\n          Pacific Publishers, Portland, Oregon, 456 pages, indexed, \\n          hardcover. \\n          \\n\\n               \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to \\n          most ALL astrophysical mysteries. \\n          \\n               This book is Volume III of a revised and enlarged \\n          edition of \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\", 1959.  \\n          Volume I is \"NOTHING BUT MOTION\" (1979), and Volume II is \\n          \"THE BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\" (1988). \\n          \\n               Most books and journal articles on the subject of \\n          astrophysics are bristling with integrals, partial \\n          differentials, and other FANCY MATHEMATICS.  In this book, by \\n          contrast, mathematics is conspicuous by its absence, except \\n          for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text.  \\n          Larson emphasizes CONCEPTS and declares that mathematical \\n          agreement with a theory does NOT guarantee its conceptual \\n          validity. \\n          \\n               Dewey B. Larson was a retired engineer with a Bachelor \\n          of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State \\n          University.  He developed the Theory described in his books \\n          while trying to find a way to MATHEMATICALLY CALCULATE the \\n          properties of chemical compounds based ONLY on the elements \\n          they contain. \\n          \\n               \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" describes the astrophysical \\n          portions of Larson\\'s CONSISTENT, INTEGRATED, COMPREHENSIVE, \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, a kind of \\n          \"grand unified field theory\" that orthodox physicists and \\n          astro-physicists CLAIM to be looking for.  It is built on two \\n          postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of \\n          space and time: \\n          \\n               (1) The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE \\n          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE \\n          units, and with two RECIPROCAL aspects, SPACE and TIME. \\n          \\n               (2) The physical universe conforms to the relations of \\n          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its primary magnitudes are \\n          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN. \\n          \\n               From these two postulates, Larson was able to build a \\n          COMPLETE theoretical universe, from photons and subatomic \\n          particles to the giant elliptical galaxies, by combining the \\n          concept of INWARD AND OUTWARD SCALAR MOTIONS with \\n          translational, vibrational, rotational, and rotational-\\n          vibrational motions.  At each step in the development, he was \\n          able to match parts of his theoretical universe with \\n          corresponding parts in the real physical universe, including \\n          EVEN THINGS NOT YET DISCOVERED.  For example, in his 1959 \\n          book, he first predicted the existence of EXPLODING GALAXIES, \\n          several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them.  They \\n          are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of his comprehensive Theory.  And \\n          when quasars were discovered, he had a related explanation \\n          ready for those also. \\n          \\n               As a result of his theory, which he called \"THE \\n          RECIPROCAL SYSTEM\", Larson TOTALLY REJECTED many of the \\n          sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists, \\n          including black holes, neutron stars, degenerate matter, \\n          quantum wave mechanics (as applied to atomic structure), \\n          \"nuclear\" physics, general relativity, relativistic mass \\n          increases, relativistic Doppler shifts, nuclear fusion in \\n          stars, and the big bang, all of which he considered to be \\n          nothing more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES.  He was very \\n          critical of the AD HOC assumptions, uncertainty principles, \\n          solutions in principle, \"no other way\" declarations, etc., \\n          used to maintain them. \\n          \\n               \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" is divided into 31 chapters.  \\n          It begins with a description of how galaxies are built from \\n          the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters, \\n          which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that \\n          accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in \\n          from the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe.  (Galaxy \\n          formation from the MYTHICAL \"big bang\" is a big mystery to \\n          orthodox astronomers.)  He then goes on to describe life \\n          cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and \\n          solar systems result from Type I supernova explosions of \\n          SINGLE stars. \\n          \\n               Several chapters are devoted to quasars which, according \\n          to Larson, are densely-packed clusters of stars that have \\n          been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies \\n          and are actually traveling FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT \\n          (although most of that speed is AWAY FROM US IN TIME). \\n          \\n               Astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against \\n          observations that contradict their theories would find \\n          Larson\\'s explanations quite valuable if considered with an \\n          OPEN MIND.  For example, they used to believe that GAMMA RAY \\n          BURSTS originated from pulsars, which exist primarily in the \\n          plane or central bulge of our galaxy.  But the new gamma ray \\n          telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from \\n          ALL DIRECTIONS UNIFORMLY and do NOT correspond with any \\n          visible objects, (except for a few cases of directional \\n          coincidence).  Larson\\'s explanation is that the gamma ray \\n          bursts originate from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the ANTI-MATTER \\n          HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls the \"cosmic \\n          sector\".  Because the anti-matter universe exists in a \\n          RECIPROCAL RELATION to our material universe, with the speed \\n          of light as the BOUNDARY between them, and has THREE \\n          dimensions of time and ONLY ONE dimension of space, the \\n          bursts can pop into our material universe ANYWHERE seemingly \\n          at random. \\n          \\n               Larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from \\n          books, journal articles, and leading physicists and \\n          astronomers.  In this book, 351 of them are superscripted \\n          with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the \\n          end of the book.  For example, a quote from the book \\n          \"Astronomy: The Cosmic Journey\", by William K. Hartmann, \\n          says, \"Our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if \\n          we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars \\n          form.... Unfortunately we cannot.\"  Larson\\'s book contains \\n          LOGICAL CONSISTENT EXPLANATIONS of such mysteries that are \\n          WORTHY OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION by ALL physicists, \\n          astronomers, and astrophysicists. \\n\\n\\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \\n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (Larson\\'s BOOKS). \\n\\n\\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \\n          IMPORTANT Book Review is ENCOURAGED. \\n\\n          \\n                                   Robert E.

It was a bit shorter\\nthan I expected.  Last year (when the stock was first down), they made a big\\npresentation on the 777, and other programs.  This year, it was much more\\nbare-bones.\\n\\nIn any case, I wanted to ask a question that the board of directors would\\nhear, and so I got there early, and figured that If I didn't get to the mike,\\nmaybe they would read mine off of a card, and so I wrote it down, and handed it\\nin.\\n\\nAfter the meeting started, Mr. Shrontz said that he would only answer written\\nquestions, in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only\\nhad monitors downstairs.  Naturally, I was crushed.\\n\\nSo, when question and answer time came, I was suprised to find my question\\nbeing read and answered.  Admittedly near the end of the ones that he took.\\nPresumably getting there early, and getting the question in early made all\\nthe difference.\\n\\nSo, on to the substance. The question was \\n\\nIs Boeing looking at anything BEYOND the high speed Civil Transport, such\\nas a commercial space launch system, and if not, how will Boeing compete\\nwith the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed\\nby Mcdonnell Douglass?\\n\\nWell, he read it without a hitch, and without editing, with impressed me,\\nthen he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question, last\\npart first.\\n\\nThis is to the best of my recollection what he said.\\n\\nAs far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have a better\\nanswer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some of our customers \\nabout that.  As far as commercialization, that is a long ways off.  The High\\nspeed Civil Transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at\\nthis point.\\n\\nSo, this tells me that Boeing still considers space to be a non-commercial\\narena, and for the most part this is true, however it also tells me that \\nthey consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them\\nto persue work on their own.\\n\\nNow, I do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing.  Actually,\\nthis is a mis-nomer, as there is no spacelifter contract for the work that this\\nguy is doing, however, he is doing work in preparation of a proposal for space\\nlifter contracts.  He won't tell me what he is doing, but maybe this is where\\nthe TSTO action is taking place at boeing.  At the very minimum, the chairman\\nof the board of boeing said that they have an approach in mind, and they are\\ntrying to do something with it.  \\n\\nAnybody know anything further?\\nIs this really news?\\nDoes this threaten further work on DC-? ?\\n\\n                    John.\\n\",\n",

The\\nday-long meeting was held in ANSER facilities in Crystal City, VA; topics\\ncovered by the SRT included a preliminary mission and goals statement for\\nthe space station; science, technology and engineering research; the\\nassessment process; and the design approach. Discussions on management\\noptions and operations concepts also were held.\\n\\nThe Design Teams then presented the three options under study:\\n\\n¥ Option A - Modular Buildup -- Pete Priest presented the A option. Priest\\nsaid the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has\\nidentified three distinct phases of evolution - power station, human tended\\nand permanent presence. The team will define the minimum capability needed\\nto achieve each phase, the total cost of each phase and the achievable\\ncapability for budget levels. The A option uses current or simplified\\nFreedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing\\nsystems such as the so-called \"Bus-1 spacecraft,\" the orbiter and Spacelab.\\n\\nThe Power Station Capability could be achieved in 3 flights with Freedom\\nphoto voltaic modules providing 20 kW of power. 30-day Shuttle/Spacelab\\nmissions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase.\\n\\nHuman Tended Capability would be provided by the addition of the U.S.\\nCommon Module Module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and docking\\nports for ESA and Japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with the orbiter\\ndocked to the station are assumed for this phase. Different\\noperation/utilization modes are being studied for this phase.\\n\\n¥ Option B - Freedom Derived -- Mike Griffin presented the status of Option\\nB activities. Griffin detailed the evolution of the Freedom-derived option,\\nfrom initial Research Capability, to Human-Tended Capability, to Permanent\\nHuman Presence Capability, to Two Fault Tolerance, and finally Permanent\\nHuman Capability. Griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the\\nbaseline program, with minor changes to the Communications and Tracking\\nsystem, Crew Health Care System and ECLSS, and a major change to the Data\\nManagement System.\\n\\nInitial Research Capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28.5 degree\\ninclination (3 flights to 51.6 degrees) and consist of an extended duration\\norbiter-Spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaic\\narrays providing 18.75 kW of power.\\n\\nHuman-Tended Capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add truss\\nsegments and the U.S. lab.\\n\\nPermanent Human Presence Capability would be achieved in 8 flights with two\\norbiters providing habitation and assured crew return.\\n\\nTwo Fault Tolerance, achieved in 11 flights, would build out the other\\nsection of truss with another set of PV modules, thermal control and\\npropulsion systems.\\n\\nThe freedom derived configuration could achieve an International Complete\\nstate with 16 flights.  Three more flights, to bring up the habitat module,\\na third PV array and two Assured Crew Return Vehicles (ACRV) would complete\\nthe Permanent Human Capability with International stage.\\n\\nGriffin told the Redesign Advisory Committee that eliminating hardware\\nwould not, by itself, meet budget guidelines for the Freedom derived\\noption.  Major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including\\nprogram management, contractor non-hardware, early utilization and\\noperations costs, he said.\\n\\n¥ Option C - Singe Launch Core Station -- Chet Vaughn presented Option C,\\nthe Single Launch Core Station concept.  A Shuttle external tank and solid\\nrocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit.  Shuttle\\nmain engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch\\nand jettisoned after ET separation.\\n\\nThe module, 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long, would provide 26,000\\ncubic feet of pressured volume, separated into 7 \"decks\" connected by a\\ncentralized passageway.  Seven berthing ports would be located at various\\nplaces on the circumference of the module to place the international\\nmodules, and other elements.  This \"can\" would have two fixed photo voltaic\\narrays producing approximately 40 kW of power flying in a solar interial\\nattitude.\\n\\nIn his closing comments to the Redesign Advisory Committee, Bryan O\\'Connor\\nsaid a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on April 26 so\\nthat detailed costing of the options can begin.  The next meeting with the\\nRedesign Advisory Committee will be May 3.\\n\\nRussian Consultants Arrive in U.S. -- A delegation of 16 Russian space\\nexperts arrived in the U.S. on April 21 and briefings to the SRT by members\\nof the Russian team began on the 22nd.  The group includes Russian Space\\nAgency General Director Y. M. Koptev, and V. A. Yatsenko, also of the RSA. \\nOthers on the team include representatives from the Ministry of Defense,\\nthe Design Bureau SALYUT, the Institute of Biomedical Problems, the\\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, NPO Energia and TsNIJMASH.  The Russian team\\nbriefed the SRT on environmental control and life support system, docking\\nsystems, the Proton launch vehicle, Mir operations and utilization, and the\\nSoyuz TM spacecraft.\\n\\nThe Russian consultants are available to the SRT to assess the capabilities\\nof the Mir space station, and the possible use of Mir and other Russian\\ncapabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign.  They will\\nbe available to the SRT through May 5.\\n\\nManagement and Operations Review Continues --  Work continued in the SRT\\nsubgroups.  The Management Group under Dr. Walt Brooks is working to\\ndevelop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a\\nfoundation for the transition to development and operations.  Various\\nmanagement options have been developed including:\\n\\n¥ Lead Center with the Center Director in the programmatic chain of\\ncommand.\\n\\n¥ Host Center with the Program Manager reporting directly to an Associate\\nAdministrator.\\n\\n¥ Skunk Works/Dedicated Program Office with a small dedicated co-located\\nhand-picked program office.\\n\\n¥ Combine Space Station with Shuttle, with the space station becoming an\\nelement of the current program.\\n\\n¥ Major Tune Up to Current Organization, with current contracts and\\ngeographical distribution maintained but streamlined.\\n\\nThe Operations Group under Dr. John Cox is building on the work of the\\nOperations Phase Assessment Team lead by Gene Kranz of NASA-JSC, which had\\nalready begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its\\npreliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible.\\n\\nAs part of its work,  the Operations Group has identified teams of agency\\nexperts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of\\nassembly and operations, utilization, maintenance and logistics and testing\\nand ground operations.\\n\\nWhat\\'s in the Week Ahead? -- The Design Support Teams will provide a\\ncomprehensive status of their option to the Station Redesign Team on Monday\\nand Tuesday at which point the design will be \"frozen\" to begin the\\ndetailed cost assessment.   Also this week, the team will begin preparing\\nfor the next round of discussions with the redesign Advisory Committee, to\\nbe held May 3.\\n\\nDr. Shea Steps Down --  Dr. Joe Shea stepped down as director of the\\nStation Redesign Team on April 22 and Bryan O\\'Connor will take over the\\nactivities of the team.  Dr. Shea submitted his resignation as assistant\\ndeputy administrator for space station analysis, but will continue to serve\\nas a special advisory to NASA Administrator Goldin and be available to\\nconsult with the SRT. Mr Goldin accepted the resignation so that a request\\nfrom Dr. Shea to reduce his workload could be accommodated.\\n\\nKey Milestones -- The key dates for the SRT as they are currently being\\ncarried on the schedule are:\\n\\nApril 26\\nDesign Freeze on Options for Costing\\n\\nApril 27\\nDesign Support Team Present Selected Options to SRT\\n\\nMay 3\\nStatus report to Redesign Advisory Committee\\n\\nMay 15\\nInterim report by Redesign Advisory Committee\\n\\nJune 7\\nFinal report to Redesign Advisory Committee\\n\\n\\n(Oct. 31-cancellation .....just my opinion...AC)\\n \\n',\n",

At 00.25 UT two people saw a bright, luminous\\n    pillar-shaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near\\n    Mikkeli. The head of the pillar was circular. The lower part\\n    was a little winding. It was like a monster they told. They\\n    were little frightened. Soon the yellowish pillar became\\n    enlarged. A bright spot like the Sun was appeared in the middle\\n    of the phenomenon. At last the light landed behind the nearby\\n    forest. Now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were\\n    visible till morning sunrise.\\n\\n    The same phenomenon was observed also by Jaakko Kokkonen in\\n    Lappeenranta. At 00.26 UT he saw a luminous yellowish trail in\\n    the low northeastern horizont. The altitude of the trail was\\n    only about 3-4 degrees. Soon the trail began to grow taller.\\n    A loop was appeared in the head of the trail. It was like a\\n    spoon. This lasted only 10 seconds. Now the altitude was about\\n    five degress above horizont. He noted a bright spot at the\\n    upper stage of loop. The spot was at magnitude -2. The loop\\n    became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of\\n    the loop. A cartwheel-shaped trail was appeared round the bright\\n    spot. After a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails\\n    were only visible in the low horizont. Luminous trails were still\\n    visible at 01.45 UT in the morning sky.\\n\\n    The phenomenon was caused by a Russian rocket. I don't know if\\n    there were satellite launches in Plesetsk Cosmodrome near\\n    Arkhangelsk, but this may be a rocket experiment too. Since 1969\\n    we have observed over 80 rocket phenomena in Finland. Most of\\n    these are rocket experiments (military missile tests?), barium\\n    experiments and other chemical releases.

As you will see, the journal is structured\\nin the following way: the editorial (first page); profiles (second page\\n-- biography of an editor, in this issue, Terry Winograd); the edited\\npart of papers (pp. 3-80); mission and research reports (A plan for\\nknowledge archives project in Japan and CSLI in Stanford, pp. 81-100);\\nand news and announcements (pp. 101-108). This structure is mentioned to\\ngive you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of the\\njournal significant, diverse, and interesting, bringing your own views\\ninto the discourse.\\n   A great emphasis is given to the so-called editorial page. This page\\nexpresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problems\\nwithin the scope of computing and informatics, extending into other\\nconcerning disciplines, e.g. cybernetics, advanced AI, cognitive sciences,\\nmind, informationally concerned neural sciences, advanced technology \\n(e.g. photonics), etc. I asked professor Terry Winograd to write this\\npage for Number 2. I certainly would appreciate very much to get\\nsuggestions or possible offers from other editors, who like to express\\ntheir strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of the\\narea in question.\\n   On the second page of each Number an editor\\'s profile is published.\\nThe aim of the profile is twofold: to show his/her professional \\nachievements, interests, scientific, and philosophical orientation on\\none side; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in which\\neditors has lived and live on the other side. This kind of story should\\nbe instructive, adequately factically faced, contributing to the \\nunderstanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live.\\n   The edited part (edited papers) is still critical. I would like to have\\na stock of accepted papers in advance, so the issuing dates of a particular\\nnumber can be fixed (e.g. January, April, July, and October). In situation\\nright now, I ask you to help me with contributions of yours or your\\ncolleagues, collaborators, students, etc. Some critical views to the\\ncontemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated.\\nA special emphasis should be given also to originality by which fresh\\nideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities.\\n   Reports of different occasions (symposia, conferences, meetings, etc.)\\nand particularly on new books, papers, and interesting events are welcome.\\nYou can send these news immediately (also by your secretary) by e-mail.\\nOn the other hand, you can send books and other publications (annual\\nreports, journals, calls for papers, etc.) for reviewing and publishing\\nin Informatica. We in the editorial staff will manage the rest.\\n   E-mail is functioning satisfactorily, so please use it in every respect.\\nYou can submit editorial notes, profiles, reports, news and even complete\\npapers written in standard LaTex format (especially formulas). We received\\nseveral final (corrected) texts in Number 1 from different sites (US,\\nRussia, etc.). In this way, you can compose reports from already typed\\ntexts, using your own choice and editing, and submit them to the contact\\nperson (matjaz.gams@ijs.si), who is always being on your disposal.

It provides a\\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\\n  \"program\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\\n  instrument.\\n\\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\\n  the development of custom code.)\\n\\nUltimage Concept VI\\n-------------------\\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\\n\\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\\n  characterization.\\n\\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\\n  be imported.\\n\\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects\\' detection, measurement, and\\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The\\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\\n  modules.\\n\\n  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can\\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight\\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are\\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\\n  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\\n  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as\\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\\n  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\\n\\n  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\\n  hole filling.\\n\\n  The program\\'s quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\\n\\n  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494\\n  707-579-1733\\n\\nIPLab Spectrum\\n--------------\\n  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\\n  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user\\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far\\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool\\n  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a\\n  movie command for cycling through windows.\\n\\n\\nMacintosh-based tools\\n=====================\\n\\nNCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more\\n---------------------------------\\n  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the\\n  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results\\n  from numerical modelling calculations.

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with\\n  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS\\n  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.\\n  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted\\n  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For\\n  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from\\n  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,\\n  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include\\n  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation\\n  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to\\n  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,\\n  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.\\n\\n  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard\\n  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,\\n  availlable from Storm Technologies.

Several steps are often required to\\n  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The\\n  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can\\n  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.

Image Analyst lets users configure\\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\\n  radiographs.\\n\\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\\n  a disk-stored image.\\n\\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\\n\\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also\\n  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.\\n\\n  Automatix, Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica, MA 01821 508-667-7900\\n\\nIPLab\\n-----\\n  Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna, VA  22180 703-281-3277\\n  FAX 703-281-2509\\n\\n  \"Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or\\n  pseudocolor/grayscale image display and manipulation.\"\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II distributed by John Wiley has\\n  integrated image analysis.\\n\\nIMAGE\\n-----\\n  from Stanford : Try anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n  It has pd source for image v2, and ready to run code for a mac under\\n  image v3.\\n\\n\\n\\nWindows/DOS PC-based tools\\n==========================\\n\\nCCD\\n---\\n  Richard Berry\\'s CCD imaging book for Willamon-Bell contains (optional?)\\n  disks with image manipulating software.

All functions can be easily accessed via the\\n  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image\\n  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that\\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\\n  modules.\\n\\n  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\\n  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and\\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\\n  ratioing.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer\\'s environments. Using\\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\\n  applications programs.\\n\\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\\n  interactively driven through this control.\\n\\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\\n\\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\\n  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The\\n  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional\\n  processing of remote sensed data.\\n\\n  For further information, please contact:\\n\\n  The Business Manager, CLOUGH Engineering Group Systems Division, 627\\n  Chapel Street, South Yarra, Australia 3141.

Supports 24-bit display\"\\n\\nHIPS\\n----\\n(Human   Information   Processing Laboratory\\'s Image Processing System)\\n\\n  Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image\\n  processing which has been used for basically all the usual image\\n  processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil\\n  exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\\n\\n  Feature description\\n\\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\\n\\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\\n\\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\\n  ``filters\\'\\'.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\\n\\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]\\n\\n  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives\\n  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional\\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS\\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of\\n  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other \\n  palettes can be generated.\\n\\n\\nSupported functions include such niceties as the following:\\n\\no  image & image: + - / * interpolation\\no  image & constant: + - / *\\no  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,\\n   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.\\no  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or\\n   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.\\no  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,\\n   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp\\n   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.

You could also refer to the 2nd edition of Foley & Van Dam.\\n\\n    On to the question.  The simple answer is that you just keep adding up\\nall the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity.  For\\nexample, if your intensity values range from 0.0 to 1.0, then keep adding up\\nand clamp the resultant values to 1.0 (you might have to clamp the lower\\nbound to 0.0 if you have dark bulbs, but that\\'s another issue =^).  So, you\\nget some illumination equation like this:\\n\\n        I = Lambient + Ldiffuse(light[n]) + Lreflected + Ltransparent\\n\\n    The contribution due to reflection is just summed with the light\\nintensity, as is the light due to transparency.  Now, a slightly less\\nhand-waving illumination equation is this:\\n\\n        I = KaLa + KdLd(light[n]) + KrLr + KtLt\\n\\n    That is, each component of the illumination equation is governed by the\\nmaterial constants Ka, Kd, Kr and Kt.  So the maximum you can get from\\ntransparency for a given object, for example, might be [0.4, 0.1, 0.5] for a\\npurple-colored glass object.\\n\\n    Hopefully this answers your question.

In a recent\\nissue, there was a paragraph in an article that pained me greatly to read.  It\\nsaid:\\n\\n  \"There\\'s nothing wrong if Microsoft setting the standards for the computer\\nindustry.  The industry NEEDS an IBM for the 90\\'s.\"\\n\\n  Where has the hacker ethic gone?  Not the \"cracker\" ethic, which is something\\nentirely different and bad, but the hacker ethic, which tells us to value the\\nfree distribution of information and yield to the hands-on imperative?  Why is\\nit that people and corporations like Bill Gates, IBM, and Intel are able to\\nhave a virtual dead lock on the computer industry?  Why is it that, if a person\\nlike myself posts messages to Usenet on how to get into the little nooks,\\ncrannies, and idiosyncrasies of a computer system, they are not given any\\nuseful information by those who know, just a badmouthing? (or are completely\\nignored)  Why is it that people like Steve Jobs have to abandon their efforts to\\nmake truly innovative products?  I ask those of you who call yourselves\\nhackers, why is this?  And further, how can you let it go on?  It is a fact\\nthat the computer industry has changed the world, and shall continue to do so\\nfor a long time to come.  It has allowed the propagation of information in a\\nvolume unheard of even twenty years ago, and has made this world even smaller\\nthan it was before.  I shudder to think what that world will be like if the\\ncorporations are allowed to have their way, perpetuating more drivel like the\\n286, Windows, and the IBM product line on the computer-using public.  \\n\\n  That is not to say I am against business per se; people who profit off of\\ninnovative, intelligent, creative designs do not bother me.  In fact, I applaud\\nit; that is the American way.  But those who manage to sell kludgy, uncreative\\nsystems to the public, and profit off of them, are the ones who are the\\nproblem.  And, unfortunately, because they have enough money to make up for\\nblunt stupidity, they can keep doing it for a very long time.\\n\\n  I put it to you thus:  Where HAS the hacker ethic gone?  If it still exists,\\nwhere?  And, if it DOES exist, why are those who call themselves \"hackers\"\\nallowing this to perpetuate itself?  Why are they not creating new, innovative,\\ninteresting ideas to stop the SOS from maintaining its choke hold on the\\ncomputer industry?\\n\\n  I await with interest what will probably be a resounding silence.\\n\\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n|  pstlb@acad3.alaska.edu     |  \"Revenge is a dish best served cold.\"       |\\n|  \"Szechuan Death\"           |          - Khan Singh                        |\\n|                             |            \"Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan\"|\\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n',\n",

One is a C program that will perform a \"morph\" between\\nany two points given the amount of frames for the morph. And then\\nit will write the points, and the function (translate, rotate, etc.) out\\nto a file. Then I have a Perl script that will read the list of functions\\nand insert them into a .pov file at a given line. I had hoped this would\\nlet me do simple animation. However, I have discovered that simply\\nperforming incremental rotations on an object will not spin a stationary\\nobject but will actually rotate the object about the axis. Now I know\\nan easy way around this would be to first translate the object to the\\norigin perform the rotation and then move it back but I know there \\nmust be another way around this. I had thought perhaps it was because\\nI had created objects at the origin and then translated them to a new\\npoint and then done the rotation, which could cause this behavior. However\\nthis occurs on objects that are not translated at all. Any help is \\nappreciated.\\n\\nttknock@bbs.santafe.edu\\n\\n',\n",

You are the *only* person I have met or spoken to who,\\nhaving quantised a 24 bit image down to 8 bits, expects this process to somehow\\nreverse when the file is saved; keeping all modificvations that heve been made\\nto the 8 bit image palette.\\n\\nPerhaps that is why you yused the singular?\\n\\n>say,\\n>person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is\\n>expected that the image still is the same. \\n\\nLook, next time you import a 24 bit image into xv look carefully at the main\\ncontrol panel - it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the 8 bit\\nimage. XV makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 24 bit\\nfile. You are the *only* person who claims this is confusing.\\n\\n>So, XV were designed\\n>without thinking about human interface and how human expect the\\n>program work -- design error.\\n\\nIs a design error the same as a bug? ;-)\\n\\nRead my lips. XV is a program for viewing and modifying 8 bit images. It lets\\nyou import other images. It shows, I would say, a good deal of thought about the\\nhuman interface. And everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it\\nwas designed for. It makes no false claims.\\n\\n>I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but\\n>it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making\\n>major change to the original design.\\n\\nIf you would come up with a solid, logical, well argued and lucid description of\\nprecisely how these proposed extensions would work, feel free to post them.

JPEG is designed for compressing either\\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\\ndrawings.\\n\\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\\nrespectively.\\n\\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\\'t\\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\\nthe fact that small color details aren\\'t perceived as well as small details\\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\\ninvisible to the eye.\\n\\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\\nfiles if you don\\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\\naren\\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\\n\\n\\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\\n\\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\\n\\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\\n\\nIf your viewing software doesn\\'t support JPEG directly, you\\'ll have to\\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\\nextra time to decompress the file.  I\\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\\n\\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\\n\\n\\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\\n\\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\\'t have 24-bit display\\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\\n\\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\\nby GIF.  JPEG can\\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\\n\\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\\nparticularly objectionable with text that\\'s only a few pixels high.\\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\\'t JPEG it.\\n\\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\\n\\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\\n\\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\\na GIF, you\\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you\\'ll have to make for yourself.\\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\\nconvert well.\\n\\n\\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\\n\\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B.\\n\\nFile\\t   Size in bytes\\t\\tComments\\n\\nship.ppm\\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\\n\\t\\t\\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\\nship.ppm.Z\\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\\n\\t\\t\\t compress doesn\\'t accomplish a lot, you\\'ll note.\\n\\t\\t\\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\\nship.gif\\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\\n\\t\\t\\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\\n\\t\\t\\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\\n\\nship.jpg95\\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\\n\\t\\t\\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\\nship.jpg75\\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\\n\\t\\t\\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\\nship.jpg50\\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\\n\\t\\t\\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\\n\\t\\t\\t for, you could tell it\\'s been JPEGed without seeing\\n\\t\\t\\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\\n\\t\\t\\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\\nship.jpg25\\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\\n\\t\\t\\t JPEG\\'s characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\\n\\t\\t\\t Still, I\\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\\n\\t\\t\\t of poorer image quality than this.\\nship.jpg5o\\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\\n\\t\\t\\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\\n\\t\\t\\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\\n\\t\\t\\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\\n\\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that\\'s a factor of four or five smaller\\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\\nratio for real-world scenes.\\n\\n\\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\\n\\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\\nit\\'s not a percentage of anything.\\n\\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\\n\\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\\n\\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\\n\\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\\n\\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\\nquality scale.  Some programs don\\'t even provide a numeric scale, just\\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\\n\\n\\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\\n\\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\\nIf you don\\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\\n(If you don\\'t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it\\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\\nthe news.answers archive.\\n\\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\\n\\n\\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\\n\\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\\nkind of system.  If you don\\'t see what you want for your machine, check out\\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\\n\\nX Windows:\\n\\nXV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other\\nimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image\\nmanipulations.  It\\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),\\nfile contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support\\nfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new\\nand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding\\nedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that\\nversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you\\'ll get\\nonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works\\nfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a\\nglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the \"save at normal size\" checkbox\\nwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.\\n\\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\\'s free ImageMagick package,\\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\\nbasic free JPEG software.\\n\\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\\nfile contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\\n\\n\\nMS-DOS:\\n\\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\\n\\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel\\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\\nThe current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic\\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\\nnot flashy, but it\\'s functional.\\n\\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\\'s Hiview.  The\\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there\\'s no denying that it\\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\\n\\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\\nVESA driver, so don\\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\\nthat the driver is missing.)\\n\\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\\nthe net for a while, but I don\\'t know any stable archive location for it.\\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\\n\\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\\'s JPEG implementation isn\\'t very good:\\nit\\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\\'d have been nice to see a\\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\\n\\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\\'t get *any*\\nof them to work, you\\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs\\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\\nhave hi-color hardware, don\\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\\nthing with hi-color displays.)\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group\\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\\n\\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\\nparticular, you can\\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\\'s proprietary\\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\\n\\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\\'s key archive site for PC-related programs\\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows:\\n\\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\\ndue to Windows\\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\\n\\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\\nBut it\\'s so fast you\\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\\n\\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\\'t create new JPEG\\nfiles, and it doesn\\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\\'s\\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\\n\\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\\n286-compatible version; if you register, you\\'ll get the 386-only version,\\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\\n\\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\\n\\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\\nmode, not in a window.\\n\\nOS/2:\\n\\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip\\n    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.

Has\\n    image manipulation & slideshow functions.  Shareware, $20.\\n\\nMacintosh:\\n\\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of\\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\\'re running System 6, you must also install\\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\\n\\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\\n\\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\\'s\\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\\nlike this behavior, some don\\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\\'s user interface is very\\nwell thought out.\\n\\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\\'s faster with QuickTime.)\\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\\n\\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\\n\\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\\n\\nApple\\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\\'s tool, and it\\'s\\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\\nit, as it\\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\\n\\nStorm Technology\\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\\'t\\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\\ndownloaded image file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\\n\\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\\ndon\\'t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\\n\\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\\nJPEG file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\\n\\nAmiga:\\n\\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\\n\\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It\\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\\n\\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\\n\\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\\n\\nIf you\\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\\n\\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\\nit\\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\\n\\nAtari ST:\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\\n\\nFor monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level\\ngrayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.\\n\\nI have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for\\nAtaris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.\\n\\nAcorn Archimedes:\\n\\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\\n\\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\\n\\nThere\\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\\n\\nNeXT:\\n\\nImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some format\\nconversions.  The current version reads JPEG but does not write it.\\nImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives at\\nsonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu, somewhere in /pub/next (both are\\ncurrently being re-organized, so it\\'s hard to point to specific\\nsub-directories).  Note that there is an older version floating around that\\ndoes not support JPEG.\\n\\n\\nPortable software for almost any system:\\n\\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You\\'ll also need a viewer program.\\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\\n\\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else\\'s files.\\n\\n\\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\\n\\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\\nThe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\\nor 192.48.96.9).

To display a full-color image, the\\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We\\'re stuck with\\nthe standard usage though.)\\n\\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\\n\\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\\nThis happens because JPEG\\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little\\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\\n\\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it\\'s nearly meaningless to talk about\\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\\n(a) hasn\\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\\nnumber of colors just isn\\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\\npalette, and the format doesn\\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.)\\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\\'t have to.\\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\\'re stuck with the sender\\'s\\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\\nFurthermore, if the sender didn\\'t use a high-quality color quantization\\nalgorithm, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\\nfor all users whose machines don\\'t match the sender\\'s display hardware.\\nJPEG\\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\\'s display\\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you\\'re stuck forevermore with what was\\nsent.\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\\'s\\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\\n\\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\\nin a machine-independent fashion.\\n\\n\\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\\n\\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\\ncoding.  This article\\'s long enough already, so I\\'m not going to say more\\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\\n\\n\\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\\n\\nThere\\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\\n\\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\\n\\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\\nvalue; it\\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\\n\\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\\n\\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\\n\\n\\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\\n\\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\\nstandards organizations.\\n\\nSince we can\\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren\\'t compatible with\\nanybody else\\'s.\\n\\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\\nthat\\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\\n    pixels and not much else.\\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the\\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\\nof JPEG-related products; it\\'s reasonably likely that future commercial\\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\\n\\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\\n\\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\\'s QuickTime\\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\\n\\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software\\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\\n\\n\\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\\n\\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\\'t read, it\\'s likely\\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\\n\\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \\'JFIF\\'.\\n\\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\\n    it\\'s worth a try, anyway.\\n\\n3.  HSI files start with \\'hsi1\\'.  You\\'re out of luck unless you have HSI\\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\\n    won\\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\\n\\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \\'JFIF\\').  Strip off\\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\\n\\n5.  Anything else: it\\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\\n    try stripping off everything before that.\\n\\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM_]C_X ...\\n\\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM:\\'-I ...\\n\\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\\n\\n\\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\\n\\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\\nat best.)\\n\\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn\\'t great enough to justify the\\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\\n\\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\\n\\n\\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\\n\\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\\nfirst time around.\\n\\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\\nfree JPEG software.  It\\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\\n\\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\\n(If you\\'re wondering why, it\\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move.\\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\\nthat\\'s a mighty limited capability!)\\n\\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\\ntransmission of images, but you don\\'t want to use it as an intermediate\\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\\n\\n\\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\\n\\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it\\'s far better to make a JPEG from\\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\\nloss of quality.\\n\\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\\ndon\\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\\n\\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\\nDon\\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\\'t\\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\\n\\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\\nsystem, XV\\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\\nway to do this.)\\n\\ncjpeg\\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\\n\\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\\ncolor noise; and JPEG can\\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\\nthan you\\'d get without smoothing.\\n\\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\\nthe output image, which you don\\'t want.  If you are an image processing\\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\\'s built-in smoother is\\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\\n\\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\\nimage, you\\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\\n\\n-- \\n\\t\\t\\ttom lane\\n\\t\\t\\torganizer, Independent JPEG Group\\nInternet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu\\tBITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie\\n',\n",

       "  'From: ldo@waikato.ac.nz (Lawrence D\\'Oliveiro, Waikato University)\\nSubject: QuickTime performance (was Re: Rumours about 3DO ???)\\nOrganization: University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand\\nLines: 67\\n\\nOK, with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime,\\nthe effects of scaling and so on, I thought I\\'d do some more tests.\\n\\nFirst of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than\\nrealistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a\\nversion of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).\\nI decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results\\n(for better or for worse).\\n\\nI pulled out a copy of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" that I had recorded off TV\\na while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there\\'s a sequence where\\nthe Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\\na portion of about 30 seconds\\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\\nstation. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\\nframes. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\\n5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\\n\\nI captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\\ncard in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\\nimported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\\nkeeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\\nto 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\\n\"2.00\" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\\nframes.\\n\\nI then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \"Raw Speed Test\" program I used\\nfor the results I\\'d been reporting earlier.\\n\\nResult: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\\n\\nThat\\'s right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\\ntest movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\\ndisk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\\nwas only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk\\n(also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\\n\\nI modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\\nscaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\\nsize. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who\\nobserved poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in\\naction, not 1.5. I\\'d try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don\\'t think it\\'s\\nentirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...\\n\\nUnscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\\n\\nThe other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\\n\"preferred\" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\\nfrom within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime\\'s normal synchronized playback).\\nA preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\\'t work too well: the playback was\\nvery jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with\\nease. I can\\'t believe that QuickTime\\'s synchronization code would add this\\nmuch overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system\\'s task\\nswitching.\\n\\nA preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn\\'t see\\nany evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight\\nstutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.\\n\\nI guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the\\nkey frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also\\nimprove the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance\\neven more...\\n\\nLawrence D\\'Oliveiro                       fone: +64-7-856-2889\\nComputer Services Dept                     fax: +64-7-838-4066\\nUniversity of Waikato            electric mail: ldo@waikato.ac.nz\\nHamilton, New Zealand    37^ 47\\' 26\" S, 175^ 19\\' 7\" E, GMT+12:00\\n',\n",

Not that much, but it was provided, and a\\nuniversity wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well\\nas salary.\\n\\nDuring WWII, the military and the defense departments found that pure\\nscientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they \\nwere not exactly in the areas of the scientists\\' expertise.  This is\\nprobably because of the \"research mind\" approach, which is not to try\\nto find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution\\nemerges.  This works in stages, and as research scientists were used to\\ndiscussion about their problems, the job got done.\\n\\nThe military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the\\nfuture, and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress was\\nunwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the\\nfuture supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as \\nNSF, to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly\\nkeep politics out.  Also, the government did a job on private foundations,\\nmaking it more difficult for them to act to support research.\\n\\nThe worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which\\nthe government supports research the university will not provide funding,\\nand in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose,\\nas has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance of\\na graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I ask\\nfor one?  The answer I will get is, \"Get the money from NSF.\"  Now the\\nmoney at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level it\\ncomes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from\\ngetting supported.  So the government is, in effect, deciding which projects\\nget supported, and how much.  \\n\\nAlso, the government decided that the \"wealth\" should be spread.  So instead\\nof having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research\\ninstitutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came into\\nbeing.  And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluating\\nreseach proposals.  As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposal\\nhas to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator conceals\\nalready done work to release it as the results of the research.  What I am\\nproposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find \\nimpossible, or I may find that it is too difficult.  In addition, tomorrow\\nI may get unexpected research results.  Possibly I may bet a bright idea\\nwhich solves yesterday\\'s too difficult problem, or a whole new approach to\\nsomething I had not considered can develop.  This is the nature of the beast, \\nand except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, it\\nis not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring \\nmore than minimal attention of a good researcher.  \\n\\nI believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would\\nhave happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the government\\nis trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders.\\n-- \\nHerman Rubin, Dept. of Statistics, Purdue Univ., West Lafayette IN47907-1399\\nPhone: (317)494-6054\\nhrubin@snap.stat.purdue.edu (Internet, bitnet)  \\n{purdue,pur-ee}!snap.stat!hrubin(UUCP)\\n',\n",

Brown Associates.\\n\\n------\\n\\nDenali bears a strong resemblance to Evans and Sutherlands Freedom graphics\\nsubsystem in several aspects of its high-level design.  Both products use\\na parallel array of 29050 processors for geometric computations.  Both\\nhave a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array of\\npixel processors.  As a result, Denali and Freedome overlap significantly\\nin performance and functionality.  Both design teams also appear to have \\nsimilar philosophies with respect to modularity, scalability, and market\\npenetration.\\n\\nThere remain, however, several important differences between the KPC and\\nE&S products.  Evans and Sutherland designed Freedom as a high-end\\ndeveloper's dream system with plenty of performance potential and\\nflexibility.  In its favor, Freedom has configurations from two to\\nsixteen floating point units, a border range that starts and ends at\\na higher price and performance levels than Denali.  All Freedom\\nsystems include a large, fixed number of pixel processors that\\nsupport a broader variety of color blending functions.  The Freedom\\ndesign treats its entire image memory as general-purpose memory, allowing\\ndevelopers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of special-purpose\\napplications.  Finally, E&S provided Freedom with very flexible otput and\\nvideo integration features for multimedia and simulation applications.  Note\\nthat KPC is working an auxiliary board for NTSC and PAL output that will not\\nrequire an external video encoder.  E&S programmable output features,\\nhowever, will remain much more flexible.\\n\\nThe KPC design team, in contrast, made Denali more of an end-user's system.\\nEntry version have better performance range and flexibility than low-end\\nFreedom configurations, and come in at more realistic mainstream price\\npoints.  Denali does not need as many 29050 modules as Freedome because\\nit uses a deeper scan-conversion pipeline to support each one, resulting\\nin better cost/performance characteristics.  Although both products provide\\nstrong support for 3D, imaging, and volume rendering, KPC recognized that\\nnot all users will want an even mix of these capabilities.  Denali's\\nconfiguration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchase\\ngeometric and pixel processing capabilities separately, and to upgrade\\nthem separately as needed.\\n\\nBoth companies have implemented hardware texture mapping at\\nworkstation price levels as a way to attack SGI's more expensive\\nVGXT and RealityEngine systems -- the only other products to provide\\nthis capability.  KPC supports point sampling and bilinear interpolation\\nof textures in hardware, but provides only software support for the higher\\nqualtiy tri-linear interpolated mipmapping method.  On balance, however, Denali\\nprovideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than E&S for most applications.\\nAside from being much more affordable, KPC solutions deliver more parallelism\\nfor texture processing and more off-screen memory for general graphics\\ndata storage.  By implementing texture mapping on its transformation\\nmodules, E&S foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levels\\nto obtain better texturing performance.  Kubota avoids this problem by linking\\ntexturing to its Frame Buffer Modules, providing a lower-cost, more scalable\\nsolution.\\n\\nHope this helps,\\n\\nBrian\\n\\nPS This was reprinted without permission.

JPEG is designed for compressing either\\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\\ndrawings.\\n\\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\\nrespectively.\\n\\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\\'t\\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\\nthe fact that small color details aren\\'t perceived as well as small details\\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\\ninvisible to the eye.\\n\\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\\nfiles if you don\\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\\naren\\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\\n\\n\\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\\n\\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\\n\\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\\n\\nIf your viewing software doesn\\'t support JPEG directly, you\\'ll have to\\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\\nextra time to decompress the file.  I\\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\\n\\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\\n\\n\\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\\n\\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\\'t have 24-bit display\\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\\n\\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\\nby GIF.  JPEG can\\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\\n\\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\\nparticularly objectionable with text that\\'s only a few pixels high.\\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\\'t JPEG it.\\n\\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\\n\\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\\n\\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\\na GIF, you\\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you\\'ll have to make for yourself.\\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\\nconvert well.\\n\\n\\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\\n\\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B.\\n\\nFile\\t   Size in bytes\\t\\tComments\\n\\nship.ppm\\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\\n\\t\\t\\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\\nship.ppm.Z\\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\\n\\t\\t\\t compress doesn\\'t accomplish a lot, you\\'ll note.\\n\\t\\t\\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\\nship.gif\\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\\n\\t\\t\\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\\n\\t\\t\\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\\n\\nship.jpg95\\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\\n\\t\\t\\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\\nship.jpg75\\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\\n\\t\\t\\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\\nship.jpg50\\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\\n\\t\\t\\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\\n\\t\\t\\t for, you could tell it\\'s been JPEGed without seeing\\n\\t\\t\\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\\n\\t\\t\\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\\nship.jpg25\\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\\n\\t\\t\\t JPEG\\'s characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\\n\\t\\t\\t Still, I\\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\\n\\t\\t\\t of poorer image quality than this.\\nship.jpg5o\\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\\n\\t\\t\\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\\n\\t\\t\\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\\n\\t\\t\\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\\n\\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that\\'s a factor of four or five smaller\\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\\nratio for real-world scenes.\\n\\n\\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\\n\\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\\nit\\'s not a percentage of anything.\\n\\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\\n\\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\\n\\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\\n\\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\\n\\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\\nquality scale.  Some programs don\\'t even provide a numeric scale, just\\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\\n\\n\\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\\n\\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\\nIf you don\\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\\n(If you don\\'t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it\\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\\nthe news.answers archive.\\n\\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\\n\\n\\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\\n\\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\\nkind of system.  If you don\\'t see what you want for your machine, check out\\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\\n\\nX Windows:\\n\\nXV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other\\nimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image\\nmanipulations.  It\\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),\\nfile contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support\\nfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new\\nand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding\\nedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that\\nversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you\\'ll get\\nonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works\\nfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a\\nglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the \"save at normal size\" checkbox\\nwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.\\n\\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\\'s free ImageMagick package,\\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\\nbasic free JPEG software.\\n\\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\\nfile contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\\n\\n\\nMS-DOS:\\n\\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\\n\\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel\\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\\nThe current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic\\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\\nnot flashy, but it\\'s functional.\\n\\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\\'s Hiview.  The\\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there\\'s no denying that it\\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\\n\\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\\nVESA driver, so don\\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\\nthat the driver is missing.)\\n\\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\\nthe net for a while, but I don\\'t know any stable archive location for it.\\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\\n\\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\\'s JPEG implementation isn\\'t very good:\\nit\\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\\'d have been nice to see a\\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\\n\\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\\'t get *any*\\nof them to work, you\\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs\\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\\nhave hi-color hardware, don\\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\\nthing with hi-color displays.)\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group\\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\\n\\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\\nparticular, you can\\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\\'s proprietary\\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\\n\\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\\'s key archive site for PC-related programs\\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows:\\n\\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\\ndue to Windows\\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\\n\\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\\nBut it\\'s so fast you\\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\\n\\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\\'t create new JPEG\\nfiles, and it doesn\\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\\'s\\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\\n\\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\\n286-compatible version; if you register, you\\'ll get the 386-only version,\\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\\n\\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\\n\\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\\nmode, not in a window.\\n\\nOS/2:\\n\\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip\\n    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.

Shareware, $20.\\n\\nMacintosh:\\n\\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of\\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\\'re running System 6, you must also install\\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\\n\\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\\n\\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\\'s\\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\\nlike this behavior, some don\\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\\'s user interface is very\\nwell thought out.\\n\\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\\'s faster with QuickTime.)\\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\\n\\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\\n\\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\\n\\nApple\\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\\'s tool, and it\\'s\\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\\nit, as it\\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\\n\\nStorm Technology\\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\\'t\\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\\ndownloaded image file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\\n\\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\\ndon\\'t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\\n\\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\\nJPEG file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\\n\\nAmiga:\\n\\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\\n\\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It\\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\\n\\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\\n\\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\\n\\nIf you\\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\\n\\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\\nit\\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\\n\\nAtari ST:\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\\n\\nFor monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level\\ngrayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.\\n\\nI have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for\\nAtaris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.\\n\\nAcorn Archimedes:\\n\\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\\n\\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\\n\\nThere\\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\\n\\n\\nPortable software for almost any system:\\n\\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You\\'ll also need a viewer program.\\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\\n\\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else\\'s files.\\n\\n\\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\\n\\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\\nThe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\\nor 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release\\nis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don\\'t forget to\\nretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.\\nIf you are on a PC and don\\'t know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may\\nprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on\\nCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.\\nIf you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest\\ncomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.\\n(If you don\\'t know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ\\narticle \"How to find sources\", referred to at the top of section 6.)\\n\\nThe free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \"JFIF\" format and image\\nfiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.\\nThe core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other\\nprograms, such as image viewers.

To display a full-color image, the\\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We\\'re stuck with\\nthe standard usage though.)\\n\\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\\n\\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\\nThis happens because JPEG\\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little\\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\\n\\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it\\'s nearly meaningless to talk about\\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\\n(a) hasn\\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\\nnumber of colors just isn\\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\\npalette, and the format doesn\\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.)\\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\\'t have to.\\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\\'re stuck with the sender\\'s\\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\\nFurthermore, if the sender didn\\'t use a high-quality color quantization\\nalgorithm, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\\nfor all users whose machines don\\'t match the sender\\'s display hardware.\\nJPEG\\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\\'s display\\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you\\'re stuck forevermore with what was\\nsent.\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\\'s\\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\\n\\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\\nin a machine-independent fashion.\\n\\n\\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\\n\\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\\ncoding.  This article\\'s long enough already, so I\\'m not going to say more\\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\\n\\n\\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\\n\\nThere\\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\\n\\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\\n\\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\\nvalue; it\\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\\n\\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\\n\\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\\n\\n\\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\\n\\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\\nstandards organizations.\\n\\nSince we can\\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren\\'t compatible with\\nanybody else\\'s.\\n\\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\\nthat\\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\\n    pixels and not much else.\\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the\\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\\nof JPEG-related products; it\\'s reasonably likely that future commercial\\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\\n\\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\\n\\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\\'s QuickTime\\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\\n\\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software\\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\\n\\n\\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\\n\\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\\'t read, it\\'s likely\\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\\n\\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \\'JFIF\\'.\\n\\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\\n    it\\'s worth a try, anyway.\\n\\n3.  HSI files start with \\'hsi1\\'.  You\\'re out of luck unless you have HSI\\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\\n    won\\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\\n\\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \\'JFIF\\').  Strip off\\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\\n\\n5.  Anything else: it\\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\\n    try stripping off everything before that.\\n\\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM_]C_X ...\\n\\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM:\\'-I ...\\n\\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\\n\\n\\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\\n\\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\\nat best.)\\n\\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn\\'t great enough to justify the\\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\\n\\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\\n\\n\\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\\n\\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\\nfirst time around.\\n\\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\\nfree JPEG software.  It\\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\\n\\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\\n(If you\\'re wondering why, it\\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move.\\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\\nthat\\'s a mighty limited capability!)\\n\\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\\ntransmission of images, but you don\\'t want to use it as an intermediate\\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\\n\\n\\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\\n\\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it\\'s far better to make a JPEG from\\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\\nloss of quality.\\n\\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\\ndon\\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\\n\\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\\nDon\\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\\'t\\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\\n\\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\\nsystem, XV\\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\\nway to do this.)\\n\\ncjpeg\\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\\n\\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\\ncolor noise; and JPEG can\\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\\nthan you\\'d get without smoothing.\\n\\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\\nthe output image, which you don\\'t want.  If you are an image processing\\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\\'s built-in smoother is\\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\\n\\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\\nimage, you\\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\\n\\n-- \\n\\t\\t\\ttom lane\\n\\t\\t\\torganizer, Independent JPEG Group\\nInternet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu\\tBITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie\\n',\n",

The LightWave software (LightWave=LightWave3D and\\nLightWave Modeler) allows and artist to create three dimensional\\nphoto-realistic images for a variety of purposes.\\n\\n-- WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? --\\n\\nThis mailing list is for those interested in the LightWave software, how\\nit operates and in ideas on how to obtain the best quality images\\navailable to them.  The list is for those who own the Toaster and\\nLightWave as well as those just interested in what can be done with the\\npackage.  We hope to share information, tips, procedures and to bond as\\na group.\\n\\n-- WHAT ARE THE RULES? --\\n\\nSince LightWave/Modeler are just a part of the Newtek Video Toaster\\nsoftware, I\\'m sure we will discuss a few items related to the operation\\nof the Toaster.  However, we will strive to keep the subject revolving\\nspecifically around the 3D software, related tools and products.\\n\\nYou do NOT have to own a Toaster to join this list!\\n\\n-- OK! HOW DO I JOIN? --\\n\\nTo become a member of the LightWave3D mailing list you must send a mail\\nmessage to the address:\\n\\n        lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com\\n\\nIn the body of the message enter:\\n\\nsubscribe lightwave-l your.name@your.site.domain\\n\\nOr just ask to be signed up and I will sign you up to the list.  At this\\npoint in time the process is manual but I hope to get an automated\\nscript based system in place soon.  There shouldn\\'t be too much of a\\ndelay in joining.  Expect a \"welcome\" message within 5 days after you\\nsend your request.  Then, expect the mail to start flowing in!\\n\\n-- HOW DO I POST TO THE LIST? --\\n\\nContributing to the list is simple.  Just mail your articles to the\\nfollowing address:\\n\\n        lightwave@bobsbox.rent.com\\n\\nYour article will be processed by the system and distributed to all\\nothers joined to the list.  Your articles will also be sent to you so\\nyou know that your article has made it to the list.  However, those\\naddresses that are either no good or no longer active will bounce back\\nto you.  So, if you post an article and another members address is no\\nlonger valid, your original article will be returned to you.  This\\ndoesn\\'t mean it hasn\\'t been posted to the list.  In fact, just the\\nopposite is true. It means that your article WAS posted and that it\\ncouldn\\'t be sent to one or more of the members of the list due to a bad\\naddress.\\n\\nNOTE: I hope to have a fix for this behavior soon.\\n\\n-- HOW DO I QUIT THE LIST? --\\n\\nSimply mail a request to be removed from the list to the same address\\nyou used to sign up:\\n\\n        lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com\\n\\nIn the body of the message enter:\\n\\nunsubscribe LightWave-l your.name@your.site.domain\\n\\nI will remove your name from the list of members.  PLEASE, if you join\\nthe list and your account is going to be closed or if you will not be\\nable to receive mail for a while, send a request to be removed from the\\nlist!  If you are just going to lose access for a short while still send\\na request for a suspension of your membership and I will suspend\\nforwarding of the articles to you.\\n\\n\\n-- WHAT ABOUT OLD ARTICLES? --\\n\\nI am currently archiving all the articles posted to the list at the\\noriginating site (bobsbox).  However, I can not continue to do this due\\nto lack of disk space.  What we need is a volunteer that will maintain a\\ncompendium of articles sent to the list.  They can compress and store\\nthem in archives on their system.  They can then periodically post an\\nindex of the contents of the compendium and any other information that\\nrelates.\\n\\nIf there are no volunteers then maybe someone can donate a large SCSI\\nhard drive to me for archival purposes. <grin>\\n\\nI have setup a mail-based file server so that anyone interested in the\\nlist can obtain information as well as the entire archive of past\\narticles, the membership listing and other information pertaining to\\nthe LightWave3D mailing list.

Plus it offers a full range of resolutions, high \\nrefresh rates as well as unique proprietary performance features.  \\nThe card is available in both 16-bit ISA bus and 32-bit VESA Local \\nbus versions (models 8500 AND 8500VL).\\n        With 1MB DRAM on board, the WINDOWSVGA 24 card offers \\nmaximum resolution up to 1,280 x 1,024 and supports a refresh rate \\nof 72Hz at 800 x 600 and resolution up to 1,024 x 768 \\nnon-interlaced. Both models provide performance many times greater \\nthan standard SVGA boards, yet conform to all current video \\nstandards.\\n        WINDOWSVGA 24 features Genoa\\'s FlickerFree(tm) technology, \\nwhich eliminates screen flash and flicker to make viewing much more \\ncomfortable.  the cards also come with Safescan(tm), a utility \\ndeveloped by Genoa to eliminate the black border around the screen \\nand thereby provide 100-percent screen use for overscanning monitors.\\n        WINDOWSVGA model 8500VL takes full advantage of the speed \\noffered by the new VESA Local bus technology.  Most VL bus cards \\nwill only handle data transfers up to 33MHz, but the 8500VL will \\ntransfer data at the full speed of the CPU, up to 50MHz.  Genoa is \\nalso offering this card in the \"TurboBahn\" combination packaged \\nwith their TURBOEXPRESS 486VL motherboard.\\n        Built around the Cirrus Logic GD-5426 GUI accelerator, \\nWINDOWSVGA 24 offers the user an exceptional price/performance \\nvalue.  Genoa\\'s advanced proprietary drivers act to \"turbocharge\" \\nthe chip, thereby providing an affordable accelerator card with \\npower and performance that surpass many of the more highly priced \\nchip cards.  The Genoa user will enjoy optimal speed and \\nreliability for such programs as Windows, AutoCAD, AutoShade, 3D \\nStudio, OS/2, OrCAD and more.  Driver updates and product bulletins \\nare available on Genoa\\'s BBS at (408) 943-1231.\\n        Genoa Systems manufactures and markets an extensive line of \\ngraphics adapters, motherboards, audio and multimedia cards for \\nIBM-compatible personal computers.

The most egregious example is that\\nrather than picking a byte order and bit order and using it consistently\\nin all TIFF files, byte and bit order are options and all TIFF readers on\\nall machines, no matter what their natural byte order, have to be prepared\\nto do byte swapping.  There are four slightly different FAX formats --\\nagain, any one of them would have been adequate.  RGB images can be stored\\nby pixel or by component, complexity without function, etc, etc.  I also\\nnote that the TIFF doc says that Aldus' experiments show that LZW reliably\\ncompresses as well or better than any of the FAX formats, suggesting that\\nnone of the FAX formats are really useful.\\n\\nWhat's worse, a lot of the formats aren't even implemented very well,\\ne.g., LZW limits code words to 12 bits, while 14 or 16 bits would have\\nprovided substantially better compression.  And the LZW method compresses\\nbytes rather than pixels.\\n\\nBut the absolute worst thing about TIFF is that any vendor can register\\nproprietary TIFF codes and formats without even publicly documenting them.\\nThis means that there is NO WAY to write a TIFF reader that can reliably\\nread all incoming TIFF files.

Ancient astronomers observed points of\\nlight that appeared to move among the stars. They called these\\nobjects planets, meaning wanderers, and named them after Roman\\ndeities -- Jupiter, king of the gods; Mars, the god of war;\\nMercury, messenger of the gods; Venus, the god of love and\\nbeauty, and Saturn, father of Jupiter and god of agriculture. The\\nstargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails, and meteors\\nor shooting stars apparently falling from the sky.\\n\\n     Science flourished during the European Renaissance.\\nFundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were\\ndiscovered, and the orbits of the planets around the Sun were\\ncalculated. In the 17th century, astronomers pointed a new device\\ncalled the telescope at the heavens and made startling\\ndiscoveries.\\n\\n     But the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age of\\nsolar system exploration. Advancements in rocketry after World\\nWar II enabled our machines to break the grip of Earth\\'s gravity\\nand travel to the Moon and to other planets.\\n\\n     The United States has sent automated spacecraft, then\\nhuman-crewed expeditions, to explore the Moon. Our automated\\nmachines have orbited and landed on Venus and Mars; explored the\\nSun\\'s environment; observed comets, and made close-range surveys\\nwhile flying past Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.\\n\\n     These travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and\\nunderstanding of the solar system. Through the electronic sight\\nand other \"senses\" of our automated spacecraft, color and\\ncomplexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared\\nto Earth-bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light.\\nAnd dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered.\\n\\n     Future historians will likely view these pioneering flights\\nthrough the solar system as some of the most remarkable\\nachievements of the 20th century.\\n     \\n\\nAUTOMATED SPACECRAFT\\n\\n     The National Aeronautics and Space Administration\\'s (NASA\\'s)\\nautomated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many\\nshapes and sizes. While they are designed to fulfill separate and\\nspecific mission objectives, the craft share much in common.\\n\\n     Each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments\\nselected for a particular mission, supported by basic subsystems\\nfor electrical power, trajectory and orientation control, as well\\nas for processing data and communicating with Earth.\\n\\n     Electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft\\ninstruments and systems. NASA uses both solar energy from arrays\\nof photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its\\nsolar system missions. Rechargeable batteries are employed for\\nbackup and supplemental power.\\n\\n     Imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed\\nmillions of miles through space to fly but one time near a\\nplanet, only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments\\npointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target! To help\\nprevent such a mishap, a subsystem of small thrusters is used to\\ncontrol spacecraft.\\n\\n     The thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a\\nconstant gaze at selected stars. Just as Earth\\'s early seafarers\\nused the stars to navigate the oceans, spacecraft use stars to\\nmaintain their bearings in space. With the subsystem locked onto\\nfixed points of reference, flight controllers can keep a\\nspacecraft\\'s scientific instruments pointed at the target body\\nand the craft\\'s communications antennas pointed toward Earth. The\\nthrusters can also be used to fine-tune the flight path and speed\\nof the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at\\nthe planned distance and on the proper trajectory.\\n\\n     Between 1959 and 1971, NASA spacecraft were dispatched to\\nstudy the Moon and the solar environment; they also scanned the\\ninner planets other than Earth -- Mercury, Venus and Mars. These\\nthree worlds, and our own, are known as the terrestrial planets\\nbecause they share a solid-rock composition.\\n\\n     For the early planetary reconnaissance missions, NASA\\nemployed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the\\nMariners. Their flights helped shape the planning of later\\nmissions. Between 1962 and 1975, seven Mariner missions conducted\\nthe first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space.\\n\\n     All of the Mariners used solar panels as their primary power\\nsource. The first and the final versions of the spacecraft had\\ntwo wings covered with photovoltaic cells. Other Mariners were\\nequipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal\\nbodies.\\n\\n     Although the Mariners ranged from the Mariner 2 Venus\\nspacecraft, weighing in at 203 kilograms (447 pounds), to the\\nMariner 9 Mars Orbiter, weighing in at 974 kilograms (2,147\\npounds), their basic design remained quite similar throughout the\\nprogram. The Mariner 5 Venus spacecraft, for example, had\\noriginally been a backup for the Mariner 4 Mars flyby. The\\nMariner 10 spacecraft sent to Venus and Mercury used components\\nleft over from the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter program.\\n\\n     In 1972, NASA launched Pioneer 10, a Jupiter spacecraft.\\nInterest was shifting to four of the outer planets -- Jupiter,\\nSaturn, Uranus and Neptune -- giant balls of dense gas quite\\ndifferent from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed.\\n\\n     Four NASA spacecraft in all -- two Pioneers and two Voyagers\\n-- were sent in the 1970s to tour the outer regions of our solar\\nsystem. Because of the distances involved, these travelers took\\nanywhere from 20 months to 12 years to reach their destinations.\\nBarring faster spacecraft, they will eventually become the first\\nhuman artifacts to journey to distant stars. Because the Sun\\'s\\nlight becomes so faint in the outer solar system, these travelers\\ndo not use solar power but instead operate on electricity\\ngenerated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes.\\n\\n     NASA also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit\\nour neighbors Mars and Venus in the middle and late 1970s. Twin\\nViking Landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weather\\nstations and as biology laboratories. Two advanced orbiters --\\ndescendants of the Mariner craft -- carried the Viking Landers\\nfrom Earth and then studied martian features from above.\\n\\n     Two drum-shaped Pioneer spacecraft visited Venus in 1978.\\nThe Pioneer Venus Orbiter was equipped with a radar instrument\\nthat allowed it to \"see\" through the planet\\'s dense cloud cover\\nto study surface features. The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe carried\\nfour probes that were dropped through the clouds. The probes and\\nthe main body -- all of which contained scientific instruments --\\nradioed information about the planet\\'s atmosphere during their\\ndescent toward the surface.\\n\\n     A new generation of automated spacecraft -- including\\nMagellan, Galileo, Ulysses, Mars Observer, the Comet\\nRendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini -- is being\\ndeveloped and sent out into the solar system to make detailed\\nexaminations that will increase our understanding of our\\nneighborhood and our own planet.\\n     \\n\\nThe Sun\\n\\n     A discussion of the objects in the solar system must start\\nwith the Sun. The Sun dwarfs the other bodies, representing\\napproximately 99.86 percent of all the mass in the solar system;\\nall of the planets, moons, asteroids, comets, dust and gas add up\\nto only about 0.14 percent. This 0.14 percent represents the\\nmaterial left over from the Sun\\'s formation. One hundred and nine\\nEarths would be required to fit across the Sun\\'s disk, and its\\ninterior could hold over 1.3 million Earths.\\n\\n     As a star, the Sun generates energy through the process of\\nfusion. The temperature at the Sun\\'s core is 15 million degrees\\nCelsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit), and the pressure there\\nis 340 billion times Earth\\'s air pressure at sea level. The Sun\\'s\\nsurface temperature of 5,500 degrees Celsius (10,000 degrees\\nFahrenheit) seems almost chilly compared to its core-temperature.\\nAt the solar core, hydrogen can fuse into helium, producing\\nenergy. The Sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streams\\nof charged particles, both extending far beyond the planets.\\n\\n     The Sun appears to have been active for 4.6 billion years\\nand has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or\\nso. At the end of its life, the Sun will start to fuse helium\\ninto heavier elements and begin to swell up, ultimately growing\\nso large that it will swallow Earth. After a billion years as a\\n\"red giant,\" it will suddenly collapse into a \"white dwarf\" --\\nthe final end product of a star like ours. It may take a trillion\\nyears to cool off completely.\\n\\n     Many spacecraft have explored the Sun\\'s environment, but\\nnone have gotten any closer to its surface than approximately\\ntwo-thirds of the distance from Earth to the Sun. Pioneers 5-11,\\nthe Pioneer Venus Orbiter, Voyagers 1 and 2 and other spacecraft\\nhave all sampled the solar environment. The Ulysses spacecraft,\\nlaunched on October 6, 1990, is a joint solar mission of NASA and\\nthe European Space Agency. After using Jupiter\\'s gravity to\\nchange its trajectory, Ulysses will fly over the Sun\\'s polar\\nregions during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range of\\nstudies using nine onboard scientific instruments.\\n\\n     We are fortunate that the Sun is exactly the way it is. If\\nit were different in almost any way, life would almost certainly\\nnever have developed on Earth.\\n     \\n\\nMercury\\n\\n     Obtaining the first close-up views of Mercury was the\\nprimary objective of the Mariner 10 spacecraft, launched on\\nNovember 3, 1973, from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After a\\njourney of nearly five months, which included a flyby of Venus,\\nthe spacecraft passed within 703 kilometers (437 miles) of the\\nsolar system\\'s innermost planet on March 29, 1974.\\n\\n     Until Mariner 10, little was known about Mercury. Even the\\nbest telescopic views from Earth showed Mercury as an indistinct\\nobject lacking any surface detail. The planet is so close to the\\nSun that it is usually lost in solar glare. When the planet is\\nvisible on Earth\\'s horizon just after sunset or before dawn, it\\nis obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere. Only radar\\ntelescopes gave any hint of Mercury\\'s surface conditions prior to\\nthe voyage of Mariner 10.\\n\\n     The photographs Mariner 10 radioed back to Earth revealed an\\nancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling our own\\nMoon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the\\nplanet. These apparently were created when Mercury\\'s interior\\ncooled and shrank, buckling the planet\\'s crust. The cliffs are as\\nhigh as 3 kilometers (2 miles) and as long as 500 kilometers (310\\nmiles).\\n\\n     Instruments on Mariner 10 discovered that Mercury has a weak\\nmagnetic field and a trace of atmosphere -- a trillionth the\\ndensity of Earth\\'s atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon, neon\\nand helium. When the planet\\'s orbit takes it closest to the Sun,\\nsurface temperatures range from 467 degrees Celsius (872 degrees\\nFahrenheit) on Mercury\\'s sunlit side to -183 degrees Celsius\\n(-298 degrees Fahrenheit) on the dark side. This range in surface\\ntemperature -- 650 degrees Celsius (1,170 degrees Fahrenheit) --\\nis the largest for a single body in the solar system. Mercury\\nliterally bakes and freezes at the same time.\\n\\n     Days and nights are long on Mercury. The combination of a\\nslow rotation relative to the stars (59 Earth days) and a rapid\\nrevolution around the Sun (88 Earth days) means that one Mercury\\nsolar day takes 176 Earth days or two Mercury years -- the time\\nit takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around the\\nSun! \\n\\n     Mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock like\\nthat of Earth. Scientists believe Mercury has a heavy iron-rich\\ncore making up slightly less than half of its volume. That would\\nmake Mercury\\'s core larger, proportionally, than the Moon\\'s core\\nor those of any of the planets.\\n\\n     After the initial Mercury encounter, Mariner 10 made two\\nadditional flybys -- on September 21, 1974, and March 16, 1975 --\\nbefore control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhausted\\nand the mission was concluded. Each flyby took place at the same\\nlocal Mercury time when the identical half of the planet was\\nilluminated; as a result, we still have not seen one-half of the\\nplanet\\'s surface.\\n     \\n\\nVenus\\n\\n     Veiled by dense cloud cover, Venus -- our nearest planetary\\nneighbor -- was the first planet to be explored. The Mariner 2\\nspacecraft, launched on August 27, 1962, was the first of more\\nthan a dozen successful American and Soviet missions to study the\\nmysterious planet. As spacecraft flew by or orbited Venus,\\nplunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on Venus\\' surface,\\nromantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid to\\nrest.\\n\\n     On December 14, 1962, Mariner 2 passed within 34,839\\nkilometers (21,648 miles) of Venus and became the first\\nspacecraft to scan another planet; onboard instruments measured\\nVenus for 42 minutes. Mariner 5, launched in June 1967, flew much\\ncloser to the planet. Passing within 4,094 kilometers (2,544\\nmiles) of Venus on the second American flyby, Mariner 5\\'s\\ninstruments measured the planet\\'s magnetic field, ionosphere,\\nradiation belts and temperatures. On its way to Mercury, Mariner\\n10 flew by Venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to Earth\\nshowing cloud circulation patterns in the Venusian atmosphere.\\n\\n     In the spring and summer of 1978, two spacecraft were\\nlaunched to further unravel the mysteries of Venus. On December 4\\nof the same year, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter became the first\\nspacecraft placed in orbit around the planet.\\n\\n     Five days later, the five separate components making up the\\nsecond spacecraft -- the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe -- entered the\\nVenusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet. The\\nfour small, independent probes and the main body radioed\\natmospheric data back to Earth during their descent toward the\\nsurface. Although designed to examine the atmosphere, one of the\\nprobes survived its impact with the surface and continued to\\ntransmit data for another hour.\\n\\n     Venus resembles Earth in size, physical composition and\\ndensity more closely than any other known planet. However,\\nspacecraft have discovered significant differences as well. For\\nexample, Venus\\' rotation (west to east) is retrograde (backward)\\ncompared to the east-to-west spin of Earth and most of the other\\nplanets.\\n\\n     Approximately 96.5 percent of Venus\\' atmosphere (95 times as\\ndense as Earth\\'s) is carbon dioxide. The principal constituent of\\nEarth\\'s atmosphere is nitrogen. Venus\\' atmosphere acts like a\\ngreenhouse, permitting solar radiation to reach the surface but\\ntrapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back into\\nspace. As a result, the planet\\'s average surface temperature is\\n482 degrees Celsius (900 degrees Fahrenheit), hot enough to melt\\nlead.\\n\\n     A radio altimeter on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter provided the\\nfirst means of seeing through the planet\\'s dense cloud cover and\\ndetermining surface features over almost the entire planet.\\nNASA\\'s Magellan spacecraft, launched on May 5, 1989, has been in\\norbit around Venus since August 10, 1990. The spacecraft uses\\nradar-mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh-resolution images\\nof the surface.\\n\\n     Magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic\\nfeatures, faults and impact craters. Huge areas of the surface\\nshow evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flows\\nlying on top of previous ones. An elevated region named Ishtar\\nTerra is a lava-filled basin as large as the United States. At\\none end of this plateau sits Maxwell Montes, a mountain the size\\nof Mount Everest. Scarring the mountain\\'s flank is a\\n100-kilometer (62-mile) wide, 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) deep\\nimpact crater named Cleopatra. (Almost all features on Venus are\\nnamed for women; Maxwell Montes, Alpha Regio and Beta Regio are\\nthe exceptions.) Craters survive on Venus for perhaps 400 million\\nyears because there is no water and very little wind erosion.\\n\\n     Extensive fault-line networks cover the planet, probably the\\nresult of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics\\non Earth. But on Venus the surface temperature is sufficient to\\nweaken the rock, which cracks just about everywhere, preventing\\nthe formation of major plates and large earthquake faults like\\nthe San Andreas Fault in California.\\n\\n     Venus\\' predominant weather pattern is a high-altitude,\\nhigh-speed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid. At\\nspeeds reaching as high as 360 kilometers (225 miles) per hour,\\nthe clouds circle the planet in only four Earth days. The\\ncirculation is in the same direction -- west to east -- as Venus\\'\\nslow rotation of 243 Earth days, whereas Earth\\'s winds blow in\\nboth directions -- west to east and east to west -- in six\\nalternating bands. Venus\\' atmosphere serves as a simplified\\nlaboratory for the study of our weather.\\n     \\n\\nEarth\\n\\n     As viewed from space, our world\\'s distinguishing\\ncharacteristics are its blue waters, brown and green land masses\\nand white clouds. We are enveloped by an ocean of air consisting\\nof 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other\\nconstituents. The only planet in the solar system known to harbor\\nlife, Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of 150 million\\nkilometers (93 million miles). Earth is the third planet from the\\nSun and the fifth largest in the solar system, with a diameter\\njust a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus.\\n\\n     Our planet\\'s rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give\\nrise to an extensive magnetic field, which, along with the\\natmosphere, shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation\\ncoming from the Sun and other stars. Earth\\'s atmosphere protects\\nus from meteors as well, most of which burn up before they can\\nstrike the surface. Active geological processes have left no\\nevidence of the pelting Earth almost certainly received soon\\nafter it formed -- about 4.6 billion years ago. Along with the\\nother newly formed planets, it was showered by space debris in\\nthe early days of the solar system.\\n\\n     From our journeys into space, we have learned much about our\\nhome planet. The first American satellite -- Explorer 1 -- was\\nlaunched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on January 31, 1958, and\\ndiscovered an intense radiation zone, now called the Van Allen\\nradiation belts, surrounding Earth.\\n\\n     Since then, other research satellites have revealed that our\\nplanet\\'s magnetic field is distorted into a tear-drop shape by\\nthe solar wind -- the stream of charged particles continuously\\nejected from the Sun. We\\'ve learned that the magnetic field does\\nnot fade off into space but has definite boundaries. And we now\\nknow that our wispy upper atmosphere, once believed calm and\\nuneventful, seethes with activity -- swelling by day and\\ncontracting by night. Affected by changes in solar activity, the\\nupper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on Earth.\\n\\n     Besides affecting Earth\\'s weather, solar activity gives rise\\nto a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. When charged\\nparticles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth\\'s magnetic\\nfield, they collide with air molecules above our planet\\'s\\nmagnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and are\\nknown as the auroras or the northern and southern lights.\\n\\n     Satellites about 35,789 kilometers (22,238 miles) out in\\nspace play a major role in daily local weather forecasting. These\\nwatchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms. Continuous\\nglobal monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and\\ncontributes to a better understanding of Earth\\'s complex weather\\nsystems.\\n\\n     From their unique vantage points, satellites can survey\\nEarth\\'s oceans, land use and resources, and monitor the planet\\'s\\nhealth. These eyes in space have saved countless lives, provided\\ntremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our\\nplanet in dangerous ways.\\n     \\n\\nThe Moon\\n\\n     The Moon is Earth\\'s single natural satellite. The first\\nhuman footsteps on an alien world were made by American\\nastronauts on the dusty surface of our airless, lifeless\\ncompanion. In preparation for the human-crewed Apollo\\nexpeditions, NASA dispatched the automated Ranger, Surveyor and\\nLunar Orbiter spacecraft to study the Moon between 1964 and 1968.\\n\\n     NASA\\'s Apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materials\\nand data. Six two-astronaut crews landed on and explored the\\nlunar surface between 1969 and 1972, carrying back a collection\\nof rocks and soil weighing a total of 382 kilograms (842 pounds)\\nand consisting of more than 2,000 separate samples.\\n\\n     From this material and other studies, scientists have\\nconstructed a history of the Moon that includes its infancy.\\nRocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about 4.0-4.3\\nbillion years old. The first few million years of the Moon\\'s\\nexistence were so violent that few traces of this period remain.\\nAs a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into\\ndifferent kinds of rock, the Moon was bombarded by huge asteroids\\nand smaller objects. Some of the asteroids were as large as Rhode\\nIsland or Delaware, and their collisions with the Moon created\\nbasins hundreds of kilometers across.\\n\\n     This catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four\\nbillion years ago, leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge,\\noverlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and broken\\nrock. Heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began to\\nmelt the interior of the Moon at depths of about 200 kilometers\\n(125 miles) below the surface. Then, for the next 700 million\\nyears -- from about 3.8 to 3.1 billion years ago -- lava rose\\nfrom inside the Moon. The lava gradually spread out over the\\nsurface, flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areas\\nthat Galileo Galilei, an astronomer of the Italian Renaissance,\\ncalled maria, meaning seas.\\n\\n     As far as we can tell, there has been no significant\\nvolcanic activity on the Moon for more than three billion years.\\nSince then, the lunar surface has been altered only by\\nmicrometeorites, by the atomic particles from the Sun and stars,\\nby the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft and\\nastronauts. If our astronauts had landed on the Moon a billion\\nyears ago, they would have seen a landscape very similar to the\\none today. Thousands of years from now, the footsteps left by the\\nApollo crews will remain sharp and clear.\\n\\n     The origin of the Moon is still a mystery. Four theories\\nattempt an explanation: the Moon formed near Earth as a separate\\nbody; it was torn from Earth; it formed somewhere else and was\\ncaptured by our planet\\'s gravity, or it was the result of a\\ncollision between Earth and an asteroid about the size of Mars.\\nThe last theory has some good support but is far from certain.\\n     \\n\\nMars\\n\\n     Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solar\\nsystem\\'s prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life.\\nAstronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw what\\nappeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface. These\\nobservations -- later determined to be optical illusions -- led\\nto the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed a\\nsystem of irrigation canals on the planet. In 1938, when Orson\\nWelles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction\\nclassic War of the Worlds  by H.G. Wells, enough people believed\\nin the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic.\\n\\n     Another reason for scientists to expect life on Mars had to\\ndo with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet\\'s\\nsurface. This phenomenon led to speculation that conditions might\\nsupport a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer months\\nand cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods.\\n\\n     So far, six American missions to Mars have been carried out.\\nFour Mariner spacecraft -- three flying by the planet and one\\nplaced into martian orbit -- surveyed the planet extensively\\nbefore the Viking Orbiters and Landers arrived.\\n\\n     Mariner 4, launched in late 1964, flew past Mars on July 14,\\n1965, coming within 9,846 kilometers (6,118 miles) of the\\nsurface. Transmitting to Earth 22 close-up pictures of the\\nplanet, the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurring\\nchannels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water.\\nMariners 6 and 7 followed with their flybys during the summer of\\n1969 and returned 201 pictures. Mariners 4, 6 and 7 showed a\\ndiversity of surface conditions as well as a thin, cold, dry\\natmosphere of carbon dioxide.\\n\\n     On May 30, 1971, the Mariner 9 Orbiter was launched on a\\nmission to make a year-long study of the martian surface. The\\nspacecraft arrived five and a half months after lift-off, only to\\nfind Mars in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm that made\\nsurface photography impossible for several weeks. But after the\\nstorm cleared, Mariner 9 began returning the first of 7,329\\npictures; these revealed previously unknown martian features,\\nincluding evidence that large amounts of water once flowed across\\nthe surface, etching river valleys and flood plains.\\n\\n     In August and September 1975, the Viking 1 and 2 spacecraft\\n-- each consisting of an orbiter and a lander -- lifted off from\\nKennedy Space Center. The mission was designed to answer several\\nquestions about the red planet, including, Is there life there?\\nNobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities, but it was\\nhoped that the biology experiments on the Viking Landers would at\\nleast find evidence of primitive life -- past or present.\\n\\n     Viking Lander 1 became the first spacecraft to successfully\\ntouch down on another planet when it landed on July 20, 1976,\\nwhile the United States was celebrating its Bicentennial. Photos\\nsent back from the Chryse Planitia (\"Plains of Gold\") showed a\\nbleak, rusty-red landscape. Panoramic images returned by the\\nlander revealed a rolling plain, littered with rocks and marked\\nby rippled sand dunes. Fine red dust from the martian soil gives\\nthe sky a salmon hue. When Viking Lander 2 touched down on Utopia\\nPlanitia on September 3, 1976, it viewed a more rolling landscape\\nthan the one seen by its predecessor -- one without visible\\ndunes.\\n\\n     The results sent back by the laboratory on each Viking\\nLander were inconclusive. Small samples of the red martian soil\\nwere tested in three different experiments designed to detect\\nbiological processes. While some of the test results seemed to\\nindicate biological activity, later analysis confirmed that this\\nactivity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet\\'s soil\\nchemistry. Is there life on Mars? No one knows for sure, but the\\nViking mission found no evidence that organic molecules exist\\nthere.\\n\\n     The Viking Landers became weather stations, recording wind\\nvelocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and\\npressure. Few weather changes were observed. The highest\\ntemperature recorded by either craft was -14 degrees Celsius (7\\ndegrees Fahrenheit) at the Viking Lander 1 site in midsummer.\\n\\n     The lowest temperature, -120 degrees Celsius (-184 degrees\\nFahrenheit), was recorded at the more northerly Viking Lander 2\\nsite during winter. Near-hurricane wind speeds were measured at\\nthe two martian weather stations during global dust storms, but\\nbecause the atmosphere is so thin, wind force is minimal. Viking\\nLander 2 photographed light patches of frost -- probably\\nwater-ice -- during its second winter on the planet.\\n\\n     The martian atmosphere, like that of Venus, is primarily\\ncarbon dioxide. Nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small\\npercentages. Martian air contains only about 1/1,000 as much\\nwater as our air, but even this small amount can condense out,\\nforming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around\\nthe slopes of towering volcanoes. Local patches of early morning\\nfog can form in valleys.\\n\\n     There is evidence that in the past a denser martian\\natmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet. Physical\\nfeatures closely resembling shorelines, gorges, riverbeds and\\nislands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet.\\n\\n     Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. They are small and\\nirregularly shaped and possess ancient, cratered surfaces. It is\\npossible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured too\\nclose to Mars and were captured by its gravity.\\n\\n     The Viking Orbiters and Landers exceeded by large margins\\ntheir design lifetimes of 120 and 90 days, respectively. The\\nfirst to fail was Viking Orbiter 2, which stopped operating on\\nJuly 24, 1978, when a leak depleted its attitude-control gas.\\nViking Lander 2 operated until April 12, 1980, when it was shut\\ndown because of battery degeneration. Viking Orbiter 1 quit on\\nAugust 7, 1980, when the last of its attitude-control gas was\\nused up. Viking Lander 1 ceased functioning on November 13, 1983.\\n\\n     Despite the inconclusive results of the Viking biology\\nexperiments, we know more about Mars than any other planet except\\nEarth. NASA\\'s Mars Observer spacecraft, to be launched in\\nSeptember 1992, will expand our knowledge of the martian\\nenvironment and lead to human exploration of the red planet. \\n     \\n\\nAsteroids\\n\\n     The solar system has a large number of rocky and metallic\\nobjects that are in orbit around the Sun but are too small to be\\nconsidered full-fledged planets. These objects are known as\\nasteroids or minor planets. Most, but not all, are found in a\\nband or belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Some have\\norbits that cross Earth\\'s path, and there is evidence that Earth\\nhas been hit by asteroids in the past. One of the least eroded,\\nbest preserved examples is the Barringer Meteor Crater near\\nWinslow, Arizona.\\n\\n     Asteroids are material left over from the formation of the\\nsolar system. One theory suggests that they are the remains of a\\nplanet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago. More\\nlikely, asteroids are material that never coalesced into a\\nplanet. In fact, if the estimated total mass of all asteroids was\\ngathered into a single object, the object would be only about\\n1,500 kilometers (932 miles) across -- less than half the\\ndiameter of our Moon. \\n\\n     Thousands of asteroids have been identified from Earth. It\\nis estimated that 100,000 are bright enough to eventually be\\nphotographed through Earth-based telescopes.\\n\\n     Much of our understanding about asteroids comes from\\nexamining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface of\\nEarth. Asteroids that are on a collision course with Earth are\\ncalled meteoroids. When a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere at\\nhigh velocity, friction causes this chunk of space matter to\\nincinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor. If the\\nmeteoroid does not burn up completely, what\\'s left strikes\\nEarth\\'s surface and is called a meteorite. One of the best places\\nto look for meteorites is the ice cap of Antarctica.\\n\\n     Of all the meteorites examined, 92.8 percent are composed of\\nsilicate (stone), and 5.7 percent are composed of iron and\\nnickel; the rest are a mixture of the three materials. Stony\\nmeteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very much\\nlike terrestrial rocks.\\n\\n     Since asteroids are material from the very early solar\\nsystem, scientists are interested in their composition.\\nSpacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found\\nthat the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids are\\nseparated by very large distances.\\n\\n     Current and future missions will fly by selected asteroids\\nfor closer examination. The Galileo Orbiter, launched by NASA in\\nOctober 1989, will investigate main-belt asteroids on its way to\\nJupiter. The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini\\nmissions will also study these far-flung objects. Scheduled for\\nlaunch in the latter part of the 1990s, the CRAF and Cassini\\nmissions are a collaborative project of NASA, the European Space\\nAgency and the federal space agencies of Germany and Italy, as\\nwell as the United States Air Force and the Department of Energy.\\nOne day, space factories will mine the asteroids for raw\\nmaterials.\\n     \\n\\nJupiter\\n\\n     Beyond Mars and the asteroid belt, in the outer regions of\\nour solar system, lie the giant planets of Jupiter, Saturn,\\nUranus and Neptune. In 1972, NASA dispatched the first of four\\nspacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of these\\ncolossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock. Jupiter\\nwas the first port of call.\\n\\n     Pioneer 10, which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center in\\nMarch 1972, was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid\\nbelt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system. In\\nDecember 1973, it returned the first close-up images of Jupiter,\\nflying within 132,252 kilometers (82,178 miles) of the planet\\'s\\nbanded cloud tops. Pioneer 11 followed a year later. Voyagers 1\\nand 2 were launched in the summer of 1977 and returned\\nspectacular photographs of Jupiter and its family of satellites\\nduring flybys in 1979.\\n\\n     These travelers found Jupiter to be a whirling ball of\\nliquid hydrogen and helium, topped with a colorful atmosphere\\ncomposed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium. Ammonia ice\\ncrystals form white Jovian clouds. Sulfur compounds (and perhaps\\nphosphorus) may produce the brown and orange hues that\\ncharacterize Jupiter\\'s atmosphere.\\n\\n     It is likely that methane, ammonia, water and other gases\\nreact to form organic molecules in the regions between the\\nplanet\\'s frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying\\nbelow. Because of Jupiter\\'s atmospheric dynamics, however, these\\norganic compounds -- if they exist -- are probably short-lived.\\n\\n     The Great Red Spot has been observed for centuries through\\ntelescopes on Earth. This hurricane-like storm in Jupiter\\'s\\natmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet. As a\\nhigh-pressure region, the Great Red Spot spins in a direction\\nopposite to that of low-pressure storms on Jupiter; it is\\nsurrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot and\\nare sometimes consumed by it. The Great Red Spot might be a\\nmillion years old.\\n\\n     Our spacecraft detected lightning in Jupiter\\'s upper\\natmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to Earth\\'s\\nnorthern lights at the Jovian polar regions. Voyager 1 returned\\nthe first images of a faint, narrow ring encircling Jupiter.\\n\\n     Largest of the solar system\\'s planets, Jupiter rotates at a\\ndizzying pace -- once every 9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds. The\\nmassive planet takes almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey\\naround the Sun. With 16 known moons, Jupiter is something of a\\nminiature solar system.\\n\\n     A new mission to Jupiter -- the Galileo Project -- is under\\nway. After a six- year cruise that takes the Galileo Orbiter once\\npast Venus, twice past Earth and the Moon and once past two\\nasteroids, the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into\\nJupiter\\'s cloud layers and relay data back to Earth. The Galileo\\nOrbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying close\\nto Jupiter\\'s large moons, exploring in detail what the two\\nPioneers and two Voyagers revealed.\\n     \\n\\nGalilean Satellites\\n\\n     In 1610, Galileo Galilei aimed his telescope at Jupiter and\\nspotted four points of light orbiting the planet. For the first\\ntime, humans had seen the moons of another world. In honor of\\ntheir discoverer, these four bodies would become known as the\\nGalilean satellites or moons. But Galileo might have happily\\ntraded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographs\\nreturned by the Voyager spacecraft as they flew past these\\nplanet-sized satellites.\\n\\n     One of the most remarkable findings of the Voyager mission\\nwas the presence of active volcanoes on the Galilean moon Io.\\nVolcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a world\\nother than Earth. The Voyager cameras identified at least nine\\nactive volcanoes on Io, with plumes of ejected material extending\\nas far as 280 kilometers (175 miles) above the moon\\'s surface.\\n\\n     Io\\'s pizza-colored terrain, marked by orange and yellow\\nhues, is probably the result of sulfur-rich materials brought to\\nthe surface by volcanic activity. Volcanic activity on this\\nsatellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the\\ngravitational tug-of-war between Io, Jupiter and the other three\\nGalilean moons.\\n\\n     Europa, approximately the same size as our Moon, is the\\nbrightest Galilean satellite. The moon\\'s surface displays a\\ncomplex array of streaks, indicating the crust has been\\nfractured. Caught in a gravitational tug-of-war like Io, Europa\\nhas been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt --\\napparently producing a liquid-water ocean. This ocean is covered\\nby an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to the\\ncold of space. Europa\\'s core is made of rock that sank to its\\ncenter.\\n\\n     Like Europa, the other two Galilean moons -- Ganymede and\\nCallisto -- are worlds of ice and rock. Ganymede is the largest\\nsatellite in the solar system -- larger than the planets Mercury\\nand Pluto. The satellite is composed of about 50 percent water or\\nice and the rest rock. Ganymede\\'s surface has areas of different\\nbrightness, indicating that, in the past, material oozed out of\\nthe moon\\'s interior and was deposited at various locations on the\\nsurface.\\n\\n     Callisto, only slightly smaller than Ganymede, has the\\nlowest density of any Galilean satellite, suggesting that large\\namounts of water are part of its composition. Callisto is the\\nmost heavily cratered object in the solar system; no activity\\nduring its history has erased old craters except more impacts.\\n\\n     Detailed studies of all the Galilean satellites will be\\nperformed by the Galileo Orbiter.\\n     \\n\\nSaturn\\n\\n     No planet in the solar system is adorned like Saturn. Its\\nexquisite ring system is unrivaled. Like Jupiter, Saturn is\\ncomposed mostly of hydrogen. But in contrast to the vivid colors\\nand wild turbulence found in Jovian clouds, Saturn\\'s atmosphere\\nhas a more subtle, butterscotch hue, and its markings are muted\\nby high-altitude haze. Given Saturn\\'s somewhat placid-looking\\nappearance, scientists were surprised at the high-velocity\\nequatorial jet stream that blows some 1,770 kilometers (1,100\\nmiles) per hour.\\n\\n     Three American spacecraft have visited Saturn. Pioneer 11\\nsped by the planet and its moon Titan in September 1979,\\nreturning the first close-up images. Voyager 1 followed in\\nNovember 1980, sending back breathtaking photographs that\\nrevealed for the first time the complexities of Saturn\\'s ring\\nsystem and moons. Voyager 2 flew by the planet and its moons in\\nAugust 1981.\\n\\n     The rings are composed of countless low-density particles\\norbiting individually around Saturn\\'s equator at progressive\\ndistances from the cloud tops. Analysis of spacecraft radio waves\\npassing through the rings showed that the particles vary widely\\nin size, ranging from dust to house-sized boulders. The rings are\\nbright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock.\\n\\n     The rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing body\\nventured too close to Saturn. The unlucky object would have been\\ntorn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in its\\ninterior. Or the object may not have been fully formed to begin\\nwith and disintegrated under the influence of Saturn\\'s gravity. A\\nthird possibility is that the object was shattered by collisions\\nwith larger objects orbiting the planet.\\n\\n     Unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each\\nother, individual ring particles appear to be held in place by\\nthe gravitational pull of Saturn and its satellites. These\\ncomplex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringlets\\nthat make up the major rings.\\n\\n     Radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an AM\\ncar radio during an electrical storm were detected by the Voyager\\nspacecraft. These emissions are typical of lightning but are\\nbelieved to be coming from Saturn\\'s ring system rather than its\\natmosphere, where no lightning was observed. As they had at\\nJupiter, the Voyagers saw a version of Earth\\'s auroras near\\nSaturn\\'s poles.\\n\\n     The Voyagers discovered new moons and found several\\nsatellites that share the same orbit. We learned that some moons\\nshepherd ring particles, maintaining Saturn\\'s rings and the gaps\\nin the rings. Saturn\\'s 18th moon was discovered in 1990 from\\nimages taken by Voyager 2 in 1981. \\n\\n     Voyager 1 determined that Titan has a nitrogen-based\\natmosphere with methane and argon -- one more like Earth\\'s in\\ncomposition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of Mars and\\nVenus. Titan\\'s surface temperature of -179 degrees Celsius (-290\\ndegrees Fahrenheit) implies that there might be water-ice islands\\nrising above oceans of ethane-methane liquid or sludge.\\nUnfortunately, Voyager\\'s cameras could not penetrate the moon\\'s\\ndense clouds.\\n\\n     Continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be\\nconverting Titan\\'s methane to ethane, acetylene and -- in\\ncombination with nitrogen -- hydrogen cyanide. The latter\\ncompound is a building block of amino acids. These conditions may\\nbe similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval Earth\\nbetween three and four billion years ago. However, Titan\\'s\\natmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit\\nprogress beyond this stage of organic chemistry.\\n\\n     The exploration of Saturn will continue with the Cassini\\nmission. The Cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will\\nalso deploy a probe called Huygens, which will be dropped into\\nTitan\\'s atmosphere and fall to the surface. Cassini will use the\\nprobe as well as radar to peer through Titan\\'s clouds and will\\nspend years examining the Saturnian system.\\n     \\n\\nUranus\\n\\n     In January 1986, four and a half years after visiting\\nSaturn, Voyager 2 completed the first close-up survey of the\\nUranian system. The brief flyby revealed more information about\\nUranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned from\\nground observations since the planet\\'s discovery over two\\ncenturies ago by the English astronomer William Herschel.\\n\\n     Uranus, third largest of the planets, is an oddball of the\\nsolar system. Unlike the other planets (with the exception of\\nPluto), this giant lies tipped on its side with its north and\\nsouth poles alternately facing the sun during an 84-year swing\\naround the solar system. During Voyager 2\\'s flyby, the south pole\\nfaced the Sun. Uranus might have been knocked over when an\\nEarth-sized object collided with it early in the life of the\\nsolar system.\\n\\n     Voyager 2 found that Uranus\\' magnetic field does not follow\\nthe usual north-south axis found on the other planets. Instead,\\nthe field is tilted 60 degrees and offset from the planet\\'s\\ncenter, a phenomenon that on Earth would be like having one\\nmagnetic pole in New York City and the other in the city of\\nDjakarta, on the island of Java in Indonesia.\\n\\n     Uranus\\' atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen, with some 12\\npercent helium and small amounts of ammonia, methane and water\\nvapor. The planet\\'s blue color occurs because methane in its\\natmosphere absorbs all other colors. Wind speeds range up to 580\\nkilometers (360 miles) per hour, and temperatures near the cloud\\ntops average -221 degrees Celsius (-366 degrees Fahrenheit).\\n\\n     Uranus\\' sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of\\nphotochemical \"smog\" believed to be a combination of acetylene,\\nethane and other sunlight-generated chemicals. Surrounding the\\nplanet\\'s atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers into\\nspace is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as \"electroglow.\"\\n\\n     Approximately 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) below Uranus\\'\\ncloud tops, there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and\\ndissolved ammonia some 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) deep.\\nBeneath this ocean is an Earth-sized core of heavier materials.\\n\\n     Voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons, 16-169 kilometers (10-105\\nmiles) in diameter, orbiting Uranus. The five previously known --\\nMiranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon -- range in size from\\n520 to 1,610 kilometers (323 to 1,000 miles) across. Representing\\na geological showcase, these five moons are half-ice, half-rock\\nspheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of past\\nactivity, including faulting and ice flows.\\n\\n     The most remarkable of Uranus\\' moons is Miranda. Its surface\\nfeatures high cliffs as well as canyons, crater-pocked plains and\\nwinding valleys. The sharp variations in terrain suggest that,\\nafter the moon formed, it was smashed apart by a collision with\\nanother body -- an event not unusual in our solar system, which\\ncontains many objects that have impact craters or are fragments\\nfrom large impacts. What is extraordinary is that Miranda\\napparently reformed with some of the material that had been in\\nits interior exposed on its surface.\\n\\n     Uranus was thought to have nine dark rings; Voyager 2 imaged\\n11. In contrast to Saturn\\'s rings, which are composed of bright\\nparticles, Uranus\\' rings are primarily made up of dark,\\nboulder-sized chunks.\\n     \\n\\nNeptune\\n\\n     Voyager 2 completed its 12-year tour of the solar system\\nwith an investigation of Neptune and the planet\\'s moons. On\\nAugust 25, 1989, the spacecraft swept to within 4,850 kilometers\\n(3,010 miles) of Neptune and then flew on to the moon Triton.\\nDuring the Neptune encounter it became clear that the planet\\'s\\natmosphere was more active than Uranus\\'. \\n\\n     Voyager 2 observed the Great Dark Spot, a circular storm the\\nsize of Earth, in Neptune\\'s atmosphere. Resembling Jupiter\\'s\\nGreat Red Spot, the storm spins counterclockwise and moves\\nwestward at almost 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) per hour. Voyager\\n2 also noted a smaller dark spot and a fast-moving cloud dubbed\\nthe \"Scooter,\" as well as high-altitude clouds over the main\\nhydrogen and helium cloud deck. The highest wind speeds of any\\nplanet were observed, up to 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) per\\nhour.\\n\\n     Like the other giant planets, Neptune has a gaseous hydrogen\\nand helium upper layer over a liquid interior. The planet\\'s core\\ncontains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the\\nother gas giants. Neptune\\'s distinctive blue appearance, like\\nUranus\\' blue color, is due to atmospheric methane.\\n\\n     Neptune\\'s magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet\\'s\\nspin axis and is not centered at the core. This phenomenon is\\nsimilar to Uranus\\' magnetic field and suggests that the fields of\\nthe two giants are being generated in an area above the cores,\\nwhere the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the\\nelectrical properties of a metal. Earth\\'s magnetic field, on the\\nother hand, is produced by its spinning metallic core and is only\\nslightly tilted and offset relative to its center.\\n\\n     Voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of Neptune\\'s rings.\\nObservations from Earth indicated that there were arcs of\\nmaterial in orbit around the giant planet. It was not clear how\\nNeptune could have arcs and how these could be kept from\\nspreading out into even, unclumped rings. Voyager 2 detected\\nthese arcs, but they were, in fact, part of thin, complete rings.\\nA number of small moons could explain the arcs, but such bodies\\nwere not spotted.\\n\\n     Astronomers had identified the Neptunian moons Triton in\\n1846 and Nereid in 1949. Voyager 2 found six more. One of the new\\nmoons -- Proteus -- is actually larger than Nereid, but since\\nProteus orbits close to Neptune, it was lost in the planet\\'s\\nglare for observers on Earth.\\n\\n      Triton circles Neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six\\ndays. Tidal forces on Triton are causing it to spiral slowly\\ntowards the planet. In 10 to 100 million years (a short time in\\nastronomical terms), the moon will be so close that Neptunian\\ngravity will tear it apart, forming a spectacular ring to\\naccompany the planet\\'s modest current rings.\\n\\n     Triton\\'s landscape is as strange and unexpected as those of\\nIo and Miranda. The moon has more rock than its counterparts at\\nSaturn and Uranus. Triton\\'s mantle is probably composed of\\nwater-ice, but the moon\\'s crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and\\nmethane. The moon shows two dramatically different types of\\nterrain: the so-called \"cantaloupe\" terrain and a receding ice\\ncap. \\n\\n     Dark streaks appear on the ice cap. These streaks are the\\nfallout from geyser-like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gas\\nand dark, fine-grained particles to heights of 2 to 8 kilometers\\n(1 to 5 miles). Triton\\'s thin atmosphere, only 1/70,000th as\\nthick as Earth\\'s, has winds that carry the dark particles and\\ndeposit them as streaks on the ice cap -- the coldest surface yet\\nfound in the solar system (-235 degrees Celsius, -391 degrees\\nFahrenheit). Triton might be more like Pluto than any other\\nobject spacecraft have so far visited.\\n     \\n\\nPluto\\n\\n     Pluto is the most distant of the planets, yet the\\neccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it inside\\nNeptune\\'s orbit, where it has been since 1979 and where it will\\nremain until March 1999. Pluto\\'s orbit is also highly inclined --\\ntilted 17 degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets.\\n\\n     Discovered in 1930, Pluto appears to be little more than a\\ncelestial snowball. The planet\\'s diameter is calculated to be\\napproximately 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles), only two-thirds the\\nsize of our Moon. Ground-based observations indicate that Pluto\\'s\\nsurface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin\\natmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet\\nmoves away from the Sun. Observations also show that Pluto\\'s spin\\naxis is tipped by 122 degrees. \\n\\n     The planet has one known satellite, Charon, discovered in\\n1978. Charon\\'s surface composition is different from Pluto\\'s: the\\nmoon appears to be covered with water-ice rather than methane\\nice. Its orbit is gravitationally locked with Pluto, so both\\nbodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other. Pluto\\'s\\nand Charon\\'s rotational period and Charon\\'s period of revolution\\nare all 6.4 Earth days. \\n\\n     Although no spacecraft have ever visited Pluto, NASA is\\ncurrently exploring the possibility of such a mission.\\n     \\n\\nComets\\n\\n     The outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay a\\nvisit to the inner planets. As asteroids are the rocky and\\nmetallic remnants of the formation of the solar system, comets\\nare the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only\\nfar from the Sun. Most comet nuclei reside in the Oort Cloud, a\\nloose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reaching\\nperhaps halfway to the nearest star.\\n\\n     Comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they are\\ngravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them close\\nto the Sun. As a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outer\\nplanets, the volatile elements of which it is made gradually\\nwarm; by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner\\nplanets, these volatile elements are boiling. The nucleus itself\\nis irregular and only a few miles across, and is made principally\\nof water-ice with methane and ammonia -- materials very similar\\nto those composing the moons of the giant planets.\\n\\n     As these materials boil off of the nucleus, they form a coma\\nor cloud-like \"head\" that can measure tens of thousands of\\nkilometers across. The coma grows as the comet gets closer to the\\nSun. The stream of charged particles coming from the Sun pushes\\non this cloud, blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving\\nrise to the comet\\'s \"tails.\" Gases and ions are blown directly\\nback from the nucleus, but dust particles are pushed more slowly.\\nAs the nucleus continues in its orbit, the dust particles are\\nleft behind in a curved arc.\\n\\n     Both the gas and dust tails point away from the Sun; in\\neffect, the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the Sun.\\nThe tails can reach 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) in\\nlength, but the total amount of material contained in this\\ndramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase. Comets --\\nfrom the Latin cometa, meaning \"long-haired\" -- are essentially\\ndramatic light shows.\\n\\n     Some comets pass through the solar system only once, but\\nothers have their orbits gravitationally modified by a close\\nencounter with one of the giant outer planets. These latter\\nvisitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly return\\nto the inner solar system.\\n\\n     Halley\\'s Comet is the most famous example of a relatively\\nshort period comet, returning on an average of once every 76\\nyears and orbiting from beyond Neptune to within Venus\\' orbit.\\nConfirmed sightings of the comet go back to 240 B.C. This regular\\nvisitor to our solar system is named for Sir Edmond Halley,\\nbecause he plotted the comet\\'s orbit and predicted its return,\\nbased on earlier sightings and Newtonian laws of motion. His name\\nbecame part of astronomical lore when, in 1759, the comet\\nreturned on schedule. Unfortunately, Sir Edmond did not live to\\nsee it.\\n\\n     A comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passes\\ncomparatively close to Earth. Unfortunately, on its most recent\\nappearance, Halley\\'s Comet passed no closer than 62.4 million\\nkilometers (38.8 million miles) from our world. The comet was\\nvisible to the naked eye, especially for viewers in the southern\\nhemisphere, but it was not spectacular. Comets have been so\\nbright, on rare occasions, that they were visible during daytime.\\nHistorically, comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omens\\nand have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky.\\n\\n     The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) spacecraft will\\nbecome the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and\\nremain in proximity to it as they both approach the Sun. CRAF\\nwill observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing\\nsunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and\\nform a coma and tails. Several spacecraft have flown by comets at\\nhigh speed; the first was NASA\\'s International Cometary Explorer\\nin 1985. An armada of five spacecraft (two Japanese, two Soviet\\nand the Giotto spacecraft from the European Space Agency) flew by\\nHalley\\'s Comet in 1986.\\n     \\n\\nConclusion\\n\\n     Despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances of\\nspace through an obscuring atmosphere, scientists of the past had\\nonly one body they could study closely -- Earth. But since 1959,\\nspaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on our\\nneighbors in space. \\n\\n     We have learned more about our solar system and its members\\nthan anyone had in the previous thousands of years. Our automated\\nspacecraft have traveled to the Moon and to all the planets\\nbeyond our world except Pluto; they have observed moons as large\\nas small planets, flown by comets and sampled the solar\\nenvironment. Astronomy books now include detailed pictures of\\nbodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes for\\ngenerations. We are lucky to be alive now to see these strange\\nand beautiful places and objects.\\n\\n     The knowledge gained from our journeys through the solar\\nsystem has redefined traditional Earth sciences like geology and\\nmeteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called\\ncomparative planetology. By studying the geology of planets,\\nmoons, asteroids and comets, and comparing differences and\\nsimilarities, we are learning more about the origin and history\\nof these bodies and the solar system as a whole.\\n\\n     We are also gaining insight into Earth\\'s complex weather\\nsystems. By seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and by\\ninvestigating the Sun\\'s activity and its influence throughout the\\nsolar system, we can better understand climatic conditions and\\nprocesses on Earth.\\n\\n     We will continue to learn and benefit as our automated\\nspacecraft explore our neighborhood in space. One current mission\\nis mapping Venus; others are flying between worlds and will reach\\nthe Sun and Jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments. Future\\nmissions are planned for Mars, Saturn, a comet and the asteroid\\nbelt.\\n\\n     We can also look forward to the time when humans will once\\nagain set foot on an alien world. Although astronauts have not\\nbeen back to the Moon since December 1972, plans are being\\nformulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the\\nhuman exploration of Mars and even the establishment of martian\\noutposts. One day, taking a holiday may mean spending a week at a\\nlunar base or a martian colony!\\n\\n- end -\\n     \\n',\n",

There are other\\nalgorithms, but this one works well and is fairly simple.  Implementations\\nare included in most raster toolkits (see item 7 below).\\n\\nA variant method is described in \"Graphics Gems\", p. 287-293.  Note that\\nthe code from the \"Graphics Gems\" series is all available from an FTP site,\\nas described above.\\n\\nCheck out John Bradley\\'s \"Diversity Algorithm\", which is incorporated into\\nthe xv package and described in the back of the manual.\\n\\nThe ImageMagick package (see section 7 for where it is) contains another\\nquantizing algorithm which is presented as \"doing a better job than the\\nother algorithms, but slower\".\\n\\nThere\\'s also an implementation of:\\n\\nWan, Wong, and Prusinkiewicz, _An Algorithm for Multidimensional Data\\nClustering_, Transactions on Mathematical Software, Vol. 14 #2 (June, 1988),\\npp. 153-162.\\n\\navialable as princeton.edu:pub/Graphics/colorquant.shar.

All of the packages mentioned can do\\nsome form of gray to b&w conversion.\\n\\n\\n6) Rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle.\\n\\nThe obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source\\nimage, transform each coordinate, and copy the pixel to the destination.\\nThis is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination.  Instead,\\nloop over the pixels in the destination image, apply the *reverse*\\ntransformation to the coordinates, and copy that pixel from the source.\\nThis method is quite general, and can be used for any one-to-one\\n2-D mapping, not just rotation.  You can add anti-aliasing by doing\\nsub-pixel sampling.\\n\\nHowever, there is a much faster method, with antialising included,\\nwhich involves doing three shear operations.  The method was originally\\ncreated for the IM Raster Toolkit (see below); an implementation is\\nalso present in PBMPLUS.  Reference: \"A Fast Algorithm for Raster\\nRotation\", by Alan Paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.waterloo.edu) Graphics\\nInterface \\'86 (Vancouver).  An article on the IM toolkit appears in\\nthe same journal.  An updated version of the rotation paper appears\\nin \"Graphics Gems\" (see section [1]) under the original title.\\n\\n\\n7) Free image manipulation software.\\n\\nThere are a number of toolkits for converting from one image format to\\nanother, doing simple image manipulations such as size scaling, plus\\nthe above-mentioned 24 -> 8, color -> gray, gray -> b&w conversions.\\nHere are pointers to some of them:\\n\\n    xv by John Bradley.  X-based image display, manipulation, and format\\n    conversion package.  XV displays many image formats and permits editing\\n    of GIF files, among others.

See item 13 below for\\ndetails on some.\\n\\nAlso, the newsgroup alt.graphics.pixutils is specifically for discussion\\nof software like this.  You may find useful information there.\\n\\n\\n8) Format documents for TIFF, IFF, BIFF, NFF, OFF, FITS, etc.\\n\\nYou almost certainly don\\'t need these.  Read the above item 7 on free\\nimage manipulation software.  Get one or more of these packages and\\nlook through them.  Chances are excellent that the image converter you\\nwere going to write is already there.  But if you still want one of the\\nformat documents, many such files are available by anonymous ftp from\\nzamenhof.cs.rice.edu in directory pub/graphics.formats.\\n\\nThese files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct.\\nThis archive includes pixel formats, and two- and three-dimensional object\\nformats.  The future of this archive is uncertain at the moment, as Mark\\nHall <foo@cs.rice.edu> will apparently no longer be maintaining it.\\n\\nA second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained\\nby Quincey Koziol (koziol@ncsa.uiuc.edu).  The latest version exists at\\nftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /misc/file.formats/graphics.formats.  Apparently,\\nneither of these is complete, you might want to check both.\\n\\nFITS stands for Flexible Image Transport System. It\\'s a file format most\\noften used in astronomy.  Despite the name, it can contain not only images\\nbut other things as well.  There is a regular monthly FITS basics and\\ninformation posting on sci.astro.fits - read it if you want to know more.\\n\\n\\n\\n9) Converting between vector formats.\\n\\nA lot of people ask about converting from HPGL to PostScript, or MacDraw\\nto CGM, or whatever.  It is important to understand that this is a very\\ndifferent problem from the image format conversions in item 7.  Converting\\none image format to another is a fairly easy problem, since once you\\nget past all the file header junk, a pixel is a pixel -- the basic objects\\nare the same for all image formats.  This is not so for vector formats.\\nThe basic objects -- circles, ellipses, drop-shadowed pattern-filled\\nround-cornered rectangles, etc. -- vary from one format to another.\\nExcept in extremely restricted cases, it is simply not possible to do\\na one-to-one conversion between vector formats.\\n\\nThere is software for converting to and from CGM files on ftp.psc.edu.  The\\ncontributor states that it runs on Unix, MS-Windows, and possibly the Mac.\\nA better, more specific blurb would be most welcome.\\n\\nOn the other hand, it is quite possible to do a close approximation,\\nrendering an image from one format using the primitives from another.\\nAs far as I know, no one has put together a general toolkit of such\\nconverters, but two different HPGL to PostScript converters have been\\nposted to comp.sources.misc.  Check the index on your nearest archive\\nsite.\\n\\nA related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format\\nto a bitmapped image - from PostScript to Sun raster format, or HPGL to\\nX11 bitmap.  For example, some of the commercial PostScript clones for\\nPC\\'s allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer.  Also,\\nthe PostScript interpreters in the NeXT box and in Sun\\'s X11/NeWs can\\nbe used to render to a file if you\\'re clever.  But in general, the\\nanswer is no.  However, if someone were to put together a vector to\\nvector conversion toolkit, adding a vector to raster converter would be\\ntrivial.\\n\\nGNU ghostscript (from the FSF - current version 2.5.2) includes\\ndrivers for both ppm and gif format files, thus it can be used as\\na PostScript to ppm  or a PostScript to GIF filter.

The approximation may look acceptable,\\nbut it is sensitive to scale.  Magnify the scale and the error of\\napproximation magnifies.  Deviations from circularity that were not\\nvisible in the small can become glaring in the large.  If you want to\\ndo the job right, consult the article:\\n\\n  \"A Menagerie of Rational B-Spline Circles\"\\n  by Leslie Piegl and Wayne Tiller\\n  in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, volume 9, number 9,\\n  September, 1989, pages 48-56.\\n\\nFor rough, non-rational approximations, consult the book:\\n\\n  Computational Geometry for Design and Manufacture\\n  by I. D. Faux and M. J. Pratt,\\n  Ellis Horwood Publishers, Halsted Press, John Wiley 1980.\\n\\nFor the best known non-rational approximations, consult the article:\\n\\n  \"Good Approximation of Circles by Curvature-continuous Bezier Curves\"\\n  by Tor Dokken, Morten Daehlen, Tom Lyche, and Knut Morken\\n  in Computer Aided Geometric Design, volume 7, numbers 1-4 (combined),\\n  June, 1990, pages 33-41 [Elsevier Science Publishers (North-Holland)]\\n\\n\\n12) How to order standards documents.\\n\\nThe American National Standards Institute sells ANSI standards, and also\\nISO (international) standards.  Their sales office is at 1-212-642-4900,\\nmailing address is 1430 Broadway, NY NY 10018.  It helps if you have the\\ncomplete name and number.\\n\\nSome useful numbers to know:\\n\\nCGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is ISO 8632-4 (1987).  GKS (Graphical\\nKernel System) is ANSI X3.124-1985.  PHIGS (Programmer\\'s Hierarchical\\nInteractive Graphics System) is ANSI X3.144-1988.  IGES is ASME/ANSI\\nY14.26M-1987.  Language bindings are often separate but related numbers;\\nfor example, the GKS FORTRAN binding is X3.124.1-1985.\\n\\nStandards-in-progress are made available at key milestones to solicit\\ncomments from the graphical public (this includes you!).  ANSI can let\\nyou know where to order them; most are available from Global Engineering\\nat 1-800-854-7179.\\n\\n\\n13) How to FTP by email.\\n\\nThere are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups\\nand make them available via an email query system.  You send a message\\nto an automated server saying something like \"send comp.sources.unix/fbm\",\\nand a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.\\n\\nIn addition, there is at least one FTP-by-mail server.  Send mail to\\nftpmail@decwrl.dec.com saying \"help\" and it will tell you how to use\\nit.  Note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse.\\n\\n\\n14) How to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon.\\n\\nConsider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to\\ninfinity.  If it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way,\\nthe point is within the polygon.  If the ray crosses an even number of\\nedges, the point is either outside the polygon, or within an interior\\nhole formed from intersecting polygon edges.  This idea is known in\\nthe trade as the Jordan curve theorem; see Eric Haines\\' article in\\nGlassner\\'s ray tracing book (above) for more information, including\\ntreatment of special cases.\\n\\nAnother method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all\\nthe vertices on the polygon.  If the sum is 2 pi, the point is inside,\\nif the sum is 0 the point is outside.  However, this method is about an\\norder of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the\\ntrigonometric functions is usually quite costly.\\n\\nCode for both methods (plus barycentric triangle testing) can be found in\\nthe Ray Tracing News, Vol. 5, No. 3, available from princeton.edu:\\npub/Graphics/RTNews/RTNv5n3.Z.\\n\\n\\n15) How to tessellate a sphere.\\n\\nOne simple way is to do recursive subdivision into triangles.  The\\nbase of the recursion is an octahedron, and then each level divides\\neach triangle into four smaller ones.  Jon Leech <leech@cs.unc.edu>\\nhas posted a nice routine called sphere.c that generates the coordinates.\\nIt\\'s available for FTP on ftp.ee.lbl.gov and princeton.edu.\\n\\n16) Specific references on ray-tracing and global illumination.\\n\\nRick Speer maintains a cross-indexed ray-tracing bibliography:\\n\\nHighlights of this edition-\\n\\n    i) more than 500 citations spanning the period from 1968 through\\n       November \\'91;\\n    ii) papers from all Siggraph, Graphics Interface, Eurographics, CG\\n        International and Ausgraph proceedings through December, \\'91;\\n    iii) all citations keyworded for easy lookup;\\n    iv) cross-indices by keyword and author;\\n    v)  glossary of the 119 keywords used.\\n\\nThe bib is in the form of a PostScript file.

It is portable and usable upon\\na wide variety of platforms.  It is quite limited in some ways (yes, the\\nkeeper of the FAQ has some opinions after all), and in fact, I don\\'t like\\nit much.  However, it looks to me like the most-Frequently Asked Question\\nwhich was not previously covered in this list.  The following is a list\\nof newsgroups and the like where one could go to find out about GIF.\\n\\nSubject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - General info\\nSubject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - OS specific info\\nNewsgroups: alt.binaries.pictures.d,alt.binaries.pictures.misc,\\n\\talt.binaries.pictures.utilities,alt.binaries.pictures.fractals,\\n\\talt.binaries.pictures.fine-art.d,news.answers\\n\\nAvailable in the indicated USENET newsgroup(s), or via anonymous ftp from\\npit-manager.mit.edu in the files:\\n\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2\\n\\nAlso available from mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu by sending a mail\\nmessage containing any or all of:\\n\\nsend usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1\\nsend usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2\\n\\nSend a message containing \"help\" to get general information about the\\nmail server.\\n\\nAlso, you could check out the resources described in sections 7, 8, and\\n20 above for more information.\\n\\n\\n22) What is morphing?\\n\\nWarping is the deformation of an image by mapping each pixel to a new\\nlocation. Morphing is blending from one image or object to another one.\\nValerie Hall has written an excellent introduction to warping and\\nmorphing. This is available for anonymous ftp from marsh.cs.curtin.edu.au\\nin the directory pub/graphics/bibliography/Morph. There are three files:\\n\\n        morph_intro.ps.Z     (PostScript version, many pictures - 1.5M)\\n        morph_intro.txt.Z    (text version)\\n        m_responses.Z        (Responses to morphing questions)\\n\\nThe files are compressed, so you must use binary transfer and\\nuncompress them afterwards.\\n\\n\\n23) How to ray-trace height fields\\n\\nHeight fields are a special case in ray-tracing.  They have a number of uses,\\nsuch as terrain rendering, and some optimization is possible.  Thus, they\\nget their own FAQ section.

Zhao)\\nSubject: Full Color Image Editor for SGI Workstations\\nOrganization: University of Houston\\nLines: 159\\nDistribution: world\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: menudo.uh.edu\\n\\n\\n   I am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program,\\n   an INTERACTIVE, FULL COLOR image viewer and editor based on SGI GL.\\n   Besides typical touchup tasks, such as crop, rotate, smooth, etc,\\n   bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs,\\n   such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image.\\n\\n   The following is the relevant sections from the man page. \\n   -----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPre-Release of May, 1993                                       BIT(1L)\\n\\nNAME\\n   bit - Bitmap Image Touchup for SGI Workstations\\n\\nDESCRIPTION\\n  bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on\\n  Silicon Graphics GL. As a full color program, bit handles images of both\\n  24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner.\\n\\n  As an image viewer, bit allows list of images to be displayed in their\\n  original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the\\n  many built-in styles of display. You can walk up and down the list using\\n  mouse and keyboard, or you can let bit do the walk for you (The\\n  SlideShow).  With the pan and zoom features, large images can be viewed\\n  in full without being limited by the window or screen size.\\n\\n  As an image editor, bit performs a large number of image editing and\\n  processing tasks accurately and efficiently. It keeps information loss\\n  at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing\\n  subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type\\n  whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization of\\n  input images. You can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into\\n  another.  In addition, arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple\\n  geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with\\n  the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take\\n  advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. PostScript).\\n\\n  Bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing\\n  image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence\\n  turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be\\n  accessed by a press of a button, and best of all, the processed image\\n  will be read back and displayed immediately. Convolution using exter-\\n  nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically\\n  giving great flexibility in processing an image.\\n\\nFEATURES\\n\\n  Bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a\\n  continuous progress report, and once the processing is complete, \\n  the processed image will be displayed.\\n\\n  Current features include\\n\\n  o Rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing\\n    and filling the \"rotated out\" region with an arbitrary color.\\n\\n  o Scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and/or y-directions with\\n    the option of subpixel sampling.\\n\\n  o Renders text of arbitrary color, size or orientation on top of an\\n    image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving\\n    the text and raster separately, such as into a PostScript file, to\\n    take advantage of a higher printer resolution. Besides normal text\\n    strings, many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as\\n    in TeX(1), e.g., $\\\\alpha$\\\\small$\\\\beta$ produces Greek alphabet alpha\\n    followed by a slightly smaller Greek alphabet beta.\\n\\n  o Presents graphically the histogram of an image.\\n\\n  o Performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation.  The transformation\\n    function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary\\n    forms. Further, the transformation can be applied to RGB channels\\n    separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of\\n    it. Many difficult tasks, such as thresholding, can be accomplished\\n    rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai-\\n    lability of graphical histograms of the image.\\n\\n  o Places simple geometric figures (SGFs), e.g., arrows, circles, trian-\\n    gles etc., of arbitrary color, size and orientation into an image at\\n    arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some\\n    user definable coordinate system units, with the option of rendering\\n    directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g,\\n    PostScript file). All SGFs can be scaled in x- and y-directions\\n    independently or simultaneously (this is how to get an ellipse from a\\n    circle).\\n\\n  o Performs edge detection. In combination with image histograms and 1-\\n    to-1 transformation, very accurate result can be obtained.\\n\\n  o Performs histogram equalization.\\n\\n  o Performs convolution with externally defined (square) matrices of\\n    arbitrary order.\\n\\n  o Crops a rectangular portion of an image.\\n\\n  o Cuts and pastes across images.\\n\\n  o Magnifies any portion of an image by any amount.\\n\\n  o Displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause\\n    interval between images. (SlideShow)\\n\\n  o Measures RGB intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels\\n    along an arbitrary line with the result presented as RGB intensities\\n    or as an intensity vs. distance plot.\\n\\n  o Performs image type conversions.\\n\\n  o Converts image formats.\\n\\n  o Smoothes an image (Special convolution).\\n\\n  o Filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image\\n    back and display it.\\n\\n  o Modify an individual pixel\\'s RGB values.\\n\\n  o Performs FFT on the entire image or a portion of it and display the\\n    resulting power spectra.\\n\\n  o Spray and brush paint in full color (unavailable in this pre-release).\\n\\n SUPPORTED FORMATS\\n      o  IRIS RGB, native to SGI IRIS\\n      o  JPEG(JFIF) format\\n      o  CompuServ GIF\\n      o  PNM(Portable Any Map), including PPM, PGM and PBM.\\n      o  XBM (X Window Bitmap)\\n      o  TIFF\\n      o  PostScript(Write only)\\n\\nHardware requirements:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n   Any SGI workstation that supports RGBmode(), including indigoes.\\n\\nWhere to get it:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n   anonymous ftp to monte.svec.uh.edu   /pub/bit/bitxxx.tar.Z\\n   where xxx is the version number.

ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that \\nuses simple, low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to \\na single PC port.  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or \\nkeypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR \\ngloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and \\nothers can be easily daisy chained to the host PC.  Applications \\nsuch as CAD/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality, \\nMultiple-Player/Single PC Games, Education and many, many more \\ncan now take advantage of ACCESS.bus, the technology that puts \\nPlug and Play on every PC.\\n\\nThe ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of \\nsystems and peripherals.  Multiple devices connect to the host \\ncomputer with only one port.  Common communication methods for a \\nnumber of device types lead to simplified hardware and software \\ndevelopment.  As an open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross-\\nplatform use of the same device.\\n\\nACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION:\\n=====================================\\n\\nACCESS.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone \\nto implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without \\nfee or royalty.\\nACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture.  That is, a single \\nhost can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  ACCESS.bus \\ndata rate is 100 Kbits/sec.\\n\\nACCESS.bus Physical Layer\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on I2C hardware \\nprotocol, with one data line and one clock line.\\nStandard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level \\nhandshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock \\nsynchronization.  \\n\\nACCESS.bus Software Protocols\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nThe ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three \\nlevels: I2C Protocol, Base Protocol, and Application Protocol.\\n\\nI2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines \\narbitration among contending masters without losing data.  I2C \\nprovides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with \\ndifferent clock rates.  Bus transactions include addressing, \\nframing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the \\nreceiver.  \\n\\nBASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between \\na host computer and multiple peripherals.  The host becomes the \\nACCESS.bus manager.  The Base Protocol defines the format of an \\nACCESS.bus message envelope, which is an I2C bus transaction with \\nadditional semantics, including checksum.\\nUnique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot \\nplugging.  Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus \\naddresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  Hot \\nplugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the \\nsystem is running, without rebooting.\\n\\nAPPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus \\nprotocol which defines message semantics specific to particular \\ntypes of devices.  Each type requires a different Application \\nProtocol.  Three broad device types have been identified: \\nkeyboards, locators, and text devices.\\n\\nACCESS.bus support on the PC\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nAll three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the \\nPC.  An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the \\nbase protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices.  \\nAn ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1 \\n- controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with \\nthe ACCESS.bus device drivers.  Drivers are available for \\nmultiple ACCESS.bus keyboards, locators and printers for DOS and \\nWindows 3.1.  Also available are C language source code examples \\nof the interface from applications to the device drivers.\\n\\n\\nTo Contact ABIG (the ACCESS.bus Industry Group):\\n------------------------------------------------\\nPostal Address:\\n370 Altair Way, Suite 215, Sunnyvale, CA 94086\\nInternet Email:  abig@netcom.com\\nFax: (408) 991-3773\\nVoice: (408) 991-3517\\n\\n\",\n",

The split\\nbetween the train and test set is based upon a messages posted before\\nand after a specific date.\\n\\nThis module contains two loaders. The first one,\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups`,\\nreturns a list of the raw texts that can be fed to text feature\\nextractors such as :class:`~sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`\\nwith custom parameters so as to extract feature vectors.\\nThe second one, :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized`,\\nreturns ready-to-use features, i.e., it is not necessary to use a feature\\nextractor.\\n\\n**Data Set Characteristics:**\\n\\n    =================   ==========\\n    Classes                     20\\n    Samples total            18846\\n    Dimensionality               1\\n    Features                  text\\n    =================   ==========\\n\\nUsage\\n~~~~~\\n\\nThe :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function is a data\\nfetching / caching functions that downloads the data archive from\\nthe original `20 newsgroups website`_, extracts the archive contents\\nin the ``~/scikit_learn_data/20news_home`` folder and calls the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.load_files` on either the training or\\ntesting set folder, or both of them::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\')\\n\\n  >>> from pprint import pprint\\n  >>> pprint(list(newsgroups_train.target_names))\\n  [\\'alt.atheism\\',\\n   \\'comp.graphics\\',\\n   \\'comp.os.ms-windows.misc\\',\\n   \\'comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware\\',\\n   \\'comp.sys.mac.hardware\\',\\n   \\'comp.windows.x\\',\\n   \\'misc.forsale\\',\\n   \\'rec.autos\\',\\n   \\'rec.motorcycles\\',\\n   \\'rec.sport.baseball\\',\\n   \\'rec.sport.hockey\\',\\n   \\'sci.crypt\\',\\n   \\'sci.electronics\\',\\n   \\'sci.med\\',\\n   \\'sci.space\\',\\n   \\'soc.religion.christian\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.guns\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.mideast\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.misc\\',\\n   \\'talk.religion.misc\\']\\n\\nThe real data lies in the ``filenames`` and ``target`` attributes. The target\\nattribute is the integer index of the category::\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n  (11314,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n  (11314,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n  array([ 7,  4,  4,  1, 14, 16, 13,  3,  2,  4])\\n\\nIt is possible to load only a sub-selection of the categories by passing the\\nlist of the categories to load to the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function::\\n\\n  >>> cats = [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\', categories=cats)\\n\\n  >>> list(newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n  (1073,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n  (1073,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n  array([0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0])\\n\\nConverting text to vectors\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIn order to feed predictive or clustering models with the text data,\\none first need to turn the text into vectors of numerical values suitable\\nfor statistical analysis. This can be achieved with the utilities of the\\n``sklearn.feature_extraction.text`` as demonstrated in the following\\nexample that extract `TF-IDF`_ vectors of unigram tokens\\nfrom a subset of 20news::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\\n  >>> categories = [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'talk.religion.misc\\',\\n  ...               \\'comp.graphics\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> vectors.shape\\n  (2034, 34118)\\n\\nThe extracted TF-IDF vectors are very sparse, with an average of 159 non-zero\\ncomponents by sample in a more than 30000-dimensional space\\n(less than .5% non-zero features)::\\n\\n  >>> vectors.nnz / float(vectors.shape[0])\\n  159.01327...\\n\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized` is a function which \\nreturns ready-to-use token counts features instead of file names.\\n\\n.. _`20 newsgroups website`: http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrennie/20Newsgroups/\\n.. _`TF-IDF`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf-idf\\n\\n\\nFiltering text for more realistic training\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIt is easy for a classifier to overfit on particular things that appear in the\\n20 Newsgroups data, such as newsgroup headers. Many classifiers achieve very\\nhigh F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\\naren\\'t from this window of time.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\\nwhich is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\\n  >>> from sklearn import metrics\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.88213...\\n\\n(The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\\nthe training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\\nmultinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\\nyet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n  ...     feature_names = np.asarray(vectorizer.get_feature_names())\\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n  ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n  ...\\n  >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n- The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n  previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n  wrote:\"\\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n  were posting at the time.\\n\\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\nsame high level.\\n\\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.77310...\\n\\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.76995...\\n\\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try\\nrunning :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py` with and without\\nthe ``--filter`` option to compare the results.\\n\\n.. topic:: Recommendation\\n\\n  When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\\n  should strip newsgroup-related metadata. In scikit-learn, you can do this by\\n  setting ``remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``. The F-score will be\\n  lower because it is more realistic.\\n\\n.. topic:: Examples\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py`\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py`\\n'}"
